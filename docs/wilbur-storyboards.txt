**Step into a world where the mundane meets the magnificent, and the ridiculous reigns supreme: WILBUR **

**Core Premise:**
WILBUR is a fresh and funny comic strip that brilliantly blends relatable teenage life with escalating surreal absurdity, a deep awareness of its own comic strip reality, and a secret world where inanimate objects have *very* strong opinions.

**Meet the Cast:**
Our perpetually perplexed protagonist is Wilbur, a 13-year-old whose genuine obliviousness to social cues is matched only by his uncanny ability to stumble into cosmic weirdness. He's often accompanied by:
Tom: His loyal, long-suffering best friend and the ultimate straight man.
Julie: Tom’s twin sister, is nearly as chaos-prone as Wilbur—and perhaps the only one who finds him charming. Her ongoing crush on him leads to both heartfelt moments and universe-level absurdities (to her eternal frustration).
Crewcut: The taller, older, and often hilariously literal or indifferent friend whose attempts to "help" when he decides too often create more chaos than solutions, and who is almost hilariously very emotionally detached from the others.
Junior Wilbur's younger brother, a child prodigy whose vast, academic intellect is perpetually misplaced on mundane or absurd matters, leading to comedic over-analysis.

**The World of "Wilbur":**
In "Wilbur," nothing is truly ordinary. Appliances have inner monologues, clouds engage in philosophical debates, and the world itself seems to possess a mischievous, unpredictable will. Yet, humans remain blissfully (or sometimes terrifyingly) oblivious to this pervasive sentience. Adults are never directly shown in panels, keeping the focus squarely on the kids navigating their bizarre reality.

**Distinctive Art Style:**
Visually, "WILBUR" has an exaggerated cartoonish, black-and-white art style. Characters feature comically oversized noses (approximately half the size of their heads!), simplified dot eyes that convey a surprising range of emotion (from exasperation to complete shock), and an expressive line work that brings every absurd situation to life.

**The Humor & Themes:**
The humor in "WILBUR" is rooted in:
Ingenious Miscommunication: Especially Wilbur's inability to grasp social nuances, leading to hilariously literal interpretations and tangents.
Deadpan Literalism: Characters like Crewcut and Wilbur often take everyday phrases to their most absurd, physical conclusion.
Chaotic Escalation: Simple situations quickly spiral into bizarre, often physical, comedy.
The Secret Lives of Objects: From bickering clouds and judgmental ducks to cynical fire hydrants and opinionated pet rocks, the hidden dialogue of inanimate objects provides a constant source of unique humor and world-building.
Meta-Commentary: Characters are frequently aware they are in a comic strip, occasionally breaking the fourth wall to appeal directly to the reader in moments of existential crisis or triumph.
Relatable Dilemmas: Friendship, crushes, sibling rivalry, and the struggles of school are all present, but consistently warped through a lens of delightful absurdity.

**Why "Wilbur"?**
In a crowded landscape, "WILBUR" offers a fresh, distinct voice that appeals to readers looking for intelligent humor that transcends the everyday. Its imaginative premise, consistently funny gags, and well-developed characters (each a source of unique humor) ensure endless comedic possibilities. Its blend of classic comic strip appeal with a modern, surreal edge will resonate across generations, inviting readers to return daily to see what new absurdity awaits.

**Format:**
Presented primarily in a classic four-panel gag format, with occasional three- or two-panel strips.

**"WILBUR" – Prepare for a world where anything is possible, and the laughs are guaranteed.**




B1-6

Panel 1:
Wilbur and Crewcut walking. 
Wilbur: “You know, what annoys me most about you is that you never actually listen to what anyone says.”

Panel 2:
Crewcut: “Thanks. That means a lot coming from you.”

Panel 3:
Wilbur stops walking, staring at him, deadpan.
Wilbur:“...You didn’t hear any of that, did you?”
Crewcut: “Hear what?”


Panel 1: A fluffy white cloud is in the center of the panel, addressing something offpanel "Hello"
Panel 2: same cloud, says "Nice day isn't it?"
Panel 3, twice as wide, zoomed out view to see what is right beside the white cloud, which is a large black storm cloud with rain pouring down under it, as it says "What're you trying to do?  Start an argument?"

(The clouds have no discernible eyes or mouths)


Panel 1: Scene of classic diamond kite in sky with string trailing down off frame.
Panel 2: same kite, but airplane is coming onto the panel, dialog off panel from below says "?"
Panel 3: The airplane is now in the center of the frame, and the string has gotten cartoonishly entangled with the wings.  Dialog off panel from below is now "!!"
Panel 4: A 13 year old grasping with both hands  on his kite roll of string as he is being whisked through the air at high speed, yelling "HELLLLP!!!!"


Panel 1
Visual Description:
Close-up to Medium Shot on WILBUR. He's animated, perhaps one hand raised, gesturing emphatically. His expression is serious and passionate. His face angled upwards slightly, adding to the "speechifying" look.
WILBUR (Speech Bubble, strong, clear font): "The insidious creep of airborne particulates threatens the very air we breathe, the skies we cherish!"
OFF-PANEL VOICE (Speech Bubble coming from the right side of the panel, slightly smaller font): "Uh huh."

Panel 2
Visual Description:
Similar framing to Panel 1, but Wilbur is in a slightly different, perhaps more intense, pose. Maybe leaning forward, fist slightly clenched.
His expression is even more earnest.
WILBUR (Speech Bubble): "We cannot stand idly by! This demands immediate, decisive action from every citizen, every household!"
OFF-PANEL VOICE (Speech Bubble, same position and style as Panel 1): "Uh huh."

Panel 3
Visual Description:
Wilbur in a climactic pose. Perhaps both hands are raised, or one is pointing upwards powerfully. He looks triumphant, like he's made an undeniable point.
WILBUR (Speech Bubble, perhaps slightly larger or bolder font for emphasis): "And only then, ONLY THEN, can we hope to breathe freely once more and secure a healthier future for generations to come!"
OFF-PANEL VOICE (Speech Bubble, same as before): "Uh huh."

Panel 4
Visual Description:
WIDER SHOT (Zoom Out). We now see WILBUR clearly, and to his right, an OLD-FASHIONED RECORD PLAYER (turntable style). The record player has a vinyl record on it
Wilbur is no longer looking at the record player. He's turned slightly, looking directly AT THE READER (breaking the fourth wall). He has a self-gratified expression.
WILBUR (Speech Bubble, addressing the reader): "It's easy to win an argument with a broken record player."
RECORD PLAYER (Speech Bubble, identical to previous): "Uh huh."



Panel 1
Visual:
Framing: Medium shot, tightly focused on a cartoonish-looking UFO. It's hovering mid-air. The panel is otherwise empty sky.
UFO Details: Simplified flying saucer with dome on top and small circular portals around the rim.
Dialogue (Speech Bubble from UFO): "Look Zerk! A bird on a leash!  We must free it!"

Panel 2
Visual:
Framing: Wider shot. The UFO is still prominent (to the left). Above and to the side, a clearly identifiable diamond-shaped kite is flying, its string trailing down off-panel.
Action: A metallic, articulated scissor-lift-like arm extends from the UFO. At the end of this arm are COMICALLY LARGE SCISSORS (blades have just closed over the kite string).
Sound Effect: "SNIP!" (Large, sharp, action-oriented lettering next to the scissors near the string. The string is visibly cut).

Panel 3
Visual:
Framing: Medium shot, focused again only on the UFO, similar to Panel 1. The kite is not visible in this panel.
Dialogue (Speech Bubble from UFO): "The bird must have been in captivity for a long time."

Panel 4
Visual:
Framing: Medium shot, focused entirely on the kite. It is now tumbling, looping, and spiraling erratically through the air, clearly out of control. Motion lines emphasize its uncontrolled descent/flight.
Background: Just sky.
Dialogue (Off-panel speech bubble, tail pointing towards where the UFO would be): "It doesn't know where to go now that we freed it."



Panel 1
Visual: Julie holds up a sealed mason jar with a gooey, vaguely twitching blob stuck inside.
Julie (serious):
“Don’t freak out, but I may have discovered a new lifeform in the garage.”
Tom (off-panel):
“If it’s near the lawnmower and smells like raisins, it’s not.”

Panel 2
Visual: Tom steps into frame, arms crossed. Julie’s eyes are wide, focused on the jar.
Julie:
“I call him Greg. He pulsed twice when I said his name. That’s deliberate communication.”
Tom:
“That’s evaporation.”

Panel 3
Visual: Julie now has a notebook and pen, taking notes.
Julie:
“I think he’s trying to warn us about something.”
Tom:
“He’s a raisin trapped in a glue trap. If he’s warning us, it’s about snacks being left unsupervised.”

Panel 4
Visual: Julie now has taped googly eyes onto the jar. Greg has a tiny paper crown on. She’s whispering reverently.
Julie:
“He says I’m his queen now.”
Tom (walking off, flat):
“I’m gonna go scream into a couch.”

B12

Panel 1:
Visual Description: Tom enters from the left. Wilbur is on his hands and knees, literally holding and pulling up the bottom-right corner of the current panel, peering intently into the white space below it. All we see of Wilburs head is the back of his head for this panel and the next.
TOM: "Hey Wilbur, whatcha doing?"
WILBUR: "Trying to peek into the future, Tom. Gotta know what tomorrow holds."

Panel 2:
Visual Description: Wilbur is still holding the panel corner up, peering down.
WILBUR: "It's... it's not blank. It's... faint. Like pencil lines. And erased smudges."

Panel 3:
Visual Description: Wilbur abruptly lets go of the panel corner, which snaps back into place with a distinct "SNAP!" SFX. He recoils, standing back on his feet, a look of profound dread on his face. Sweat beads are flying off his head. He gestures wildly at the corner he was examining. Tom looks utterly confused.
WILBUR: "My future isn't written yet, Tom! It's still being... drafted! It's all... rough sketches!"

Panel 4:
Visual Description: Wilbur is now full-blown panicking, clutching his head with both hands, white circles of shock around his eyes. Sweat beads continue flying off his head.Tom is standing a little to the side, looking vaguely puzzled. His gaze directed entirely at Wilbur.  
WILBUR: "We're all just... PRE-PRODUCTION! What if the artist gets tired?! Or changes the plot?! Or gets artist's block on Tuesday evenings and we just... stay like this forever?!"



B13-B18

Panel 1: JULIE and TOM are walking side-by-side.  Wilbur is a few feet behind them.  Julie looks nervous but determined.
JULIE: "Tom, I'm going to tell Wilbur how I feel about him."
TOM: (Looks surprised, then a hint of a supportive smile) "Really? That's... bold."

Panel 2: Close-up on JULIE, eyes wide with determination. Her dot eyes show a hint of anxiety around them. Wilbur has a confused expression.
JULIE: "Wilbur, there's something really important I need to tell you."

Panel 3: JULIE's expression shifts a bit, getting nervous.
JULIE: (Exasperated, slightly) "Iit's about... us, Wilbur"

Panel 4: WILBUR's eyes light up, looking thoughtful, his head tilting.
WILBUR: "Oh! You mean like, if aliens landed, would they prefer to communicate with us using charades or interpretive dance? Because I've got theories!"
(TOM, now visible, facepalms, a large "Sigh" sound effect floating above him).


Panel 1: JULIE stands close to WILBUR, hands slightly outstretched, trying to convey a feeling. TOM is watching in the background, rubbing his temples.
JULIE: "Wilbur, when I'm with you, I feel like... like the world just opens up!"

Panel 2: WILBUR looks around, confused, then points to something on the ground.
WILBUR: "Like that manhole cover over there? It does open up. We should get it closed, it's a safety hazard."

Panel 3: JULIE tries again, perhaps miming a heart or something similar, looking more desperate.
JULIE: "No, like a feeling! A connection! I have a magnetic attraction to you!"

Panel 4: WILBUR ponders, then his eyes widen, dot eyes large with realization. He starts reaching out and pulling his hands apart, as if testing the tension of an invisible elastic band. His expression is serious, like he's conducting an experiment.
WILBUR: "Wait, are we... magnetic?  When did this happen?  Do you really have a steel plate in your head?"
(TOM has slumped against a wall, eyes closed in despair.)


Panel 1: TOM pulls WILBUR aside, a serious expression. JULIE watches anxiously from a distance.
TOM: "Wilbur, about Julie... she has very strong feelings for you."

Panel 2: WILBUR nods sagely
WILBUR: "Yes, I've noticed. She's very passionate about civic duty. Like how we should all recycle more, or the importance of proper sidewalk etiquette."

Panel 3: TOM sighs, trying again, his expression growing strained.
TOM: "No, I mean... she likes you, Wilbur. You know, like likes you. Like... a crush."

Panel 4: WILBUR looks thoughtful, then snaps his fingers, his dot eyes bright.
WILBUR: "Oh! So she likes me the way I like that new brand of pickled okra? That's good to know! We have common ground now!"
(JULIE drops her head with a visible "Thud" sound effect as it hits the ground.)


Panel 1: TOM is now desperate, grabbing WILBUR by the shoulders, shaking him slightly. JULIE stands by, arms crossed, looking utterly defeated.
TOM: "Wilbur! Julie wants to be your GIRLFRIEND! As in, ROMANTICALLY! She has a crush on you!"

Panel 2: WILBUR stares blankly, then scratches his head, one dot eye squinting slightly.
WILBUR: "Girl... friend? You mean like a girl who is a friend? But she's already my friend!"

Panel 3: TOM pulls at his hair, his eyes squeezed shut in frustration.
TOM: "No, like, more than a friend! Like, holding hands! And maybe... gasp... sharing a root beer float with two straws!"

Panel 4: WILBUR's eyes light up, looking excited, a wide, enthusiastic smile.
WILBUR: "Woah! Sharing a root beer float with two straws?! You mean like, one glass for two people?! That's pretty advanced for friendship, Tom! Are we really ready for that commitment?!"
JULIE (eyes rolling up): "GNNNNNH!"

Panel 1: JULIE is now looking resigned, but tries one last time, very plainly. WILBUR is looking at her, perhaps slightly puzzled by her previous behavior.
JULIE: "Wilbur, I like you more than just a friend. I... I have a crush on you. I want to be your girlfriend."
SFX: BOOM! CRASH (lightning in background)

Panel 2: He's leaning in slightly.
WILBUR (shouting): "What did you say?"

Panel 3: Suddenly, thick, vertical rain lines appear, as if a sudden, very localized downpour has started right above Wilbur's head. His expression changes to surprise/annoyance, eyes widening (perhaps the white circle of shock around one eye, or just a look of pure, immediate confusion).
(Sound effects: "POUR!" "DRIP!" "SPLATTER!")

Panel 4: WILBUR is still looking up into the localized rain, with an annoyed or bewildered expression, oblivious to everything else. JULIE stands beside him, looking down, utterly defeated.
WILBUR: (To the sky, with an exclamation mark, ignoring Julie completely) "Hey! It was sunny five seconds ago! What's the big idea?!"
JULIE: (Thought bubble, tiny font): ...He really is that oblivious.

Panel 1: JULIE and TOM are walking side-by-side, Julie looking contemplative, Tom looking sympathetic.
OM: "So... are you okay, Julie?"

Panel 2: JULIE sighs, a small smile forming on her face. Her expression is softer now.
JULIE: "Yeah, Tom. I guess... it just wasn't meant to be, right now."

Panel 3: Close-up on JULIE's face. Her expression is now peaceful, thoughtful, a hint of genuine affection for Wilbur.
JULIE: "And honestly, his friendship is really important to me. I don't want to mess that up."

Panel 4: Wider shot. JULIE and TOM walk off-panel into the distance. In the foreground, WILBUR is visible, completely oblivious, perhaps trying to argue with a lamppost or measuring the air with a stick. He's smiling, a typical "Wilbur" look.
JULIE: (Off-panel, final speech bubble, reflective) "Besides... I can always try again someday."
WILBUR: (To the LAMPOST): "... And that's why the square root of cheese is always yellow!"
(LAMPOST, thought bubble, small and tired): ...I'm just a lamppost.

Summer (20)  (last summer strip should be B60

B20

Panel 1: Wide shot of a row of closed, dented, slightly sticker-covered middle school lockers. 
Locker 127: “Well, that’s it. Another year of half-zipped backpacks, slammed doors, and mysterious tuna smells.  Hello Summer!”

Panel 2: Closer view of Lockers 126, 127, and 128. 
Locker 126: “I still have a sandwich in me from October. I think it evolved.”
Locker 128: “Lucky. I housed a gym uniform so foul, it burned a hole in my bottom shelf.”

Panel 3: Slightly tighter view. The mood is reflective.
Locker 127: “Hey… anyone feel kinda empty now?”
Locker 128: “Emotionally or literally?”
Locker 126: “Both. But also there’s definitely something alive in me now.”

Panel 4: Zoom out to include locker 129.
From Locker 129: “…guys? School’s out? …hello??”
Locker 127: “Oh crap. We forgot about Greg.”
Locker 126: “AGAIN?!”


B21-29

Panel 1:
Wilbur stands in his messy room, a giant, overflowing duffel bag at his feet. His nose is practically buried in a camp checklist.
WILBUR (Thought Bubble): "Okay, mosquito repellent, check. Sunscreen, check. 7 pairs of socks for a 5-day camp... better make it 12."

Panel 2:
Junior walks in, looking at the massive duffel bag.
JUNIOR: "Going on an Arctic expedition, Wilbur? Or just to Camp Wannasweep?"

Panel 3:
Wilbur struggles to zip the duffel bag. It's bulging comically.
WILBUR "You never know what you'll need, Junior! Preparedness is key!"

Panel 4:
The duffel bag bursts open, clothes and random items (like a rubber chicken, small anvil – for comedic absurdity) flying everywhere. Junior stands amidst the chaos, arms crossed.
JUNIOR: "Indeed. Prepared for an explosion, apparently."


Panel 1:
Wilbur arrives at a rustic cabin, looking a bit apprehensive. He's dragging his (now slightly less overstuffed but still large) bag.  He's wearing a camp bandana, as are all the campers.
WILBUR (Thought Bubble): "Cabin 7... 'The Squirrel's Nest.' Charming."

Panel 2:
Inside, Wilbur meets an Other Camp Kid (OCK1) who is wearing leaves in his hair and has dirt smudges on his face. OCK1 is sniffing a pinecone intently.
OCK1: "Welcome, brother of the wild! I'm Chip. I've already communed with the spirit of this cabin."

Panel 3:
Wilbur cautiously puts his bag on an empty bunk. Chip is now trying to "talk" to a spider web in the corner.
WILBUR: "Uh, hi Chip. I'm Wilbur. So... any actual squirrels in the 'Squirrel's Nest'?"

Panel 4:
Close up on Wilbur's face, looking horrified. Chip is now holding a live (cartoonishly large) beetle, offering it to Wilbur.
CHIP: "Not yet! But I found us a roommate! He says his name is 'Crunchy.'"
WILBUR (Small thought bubble): "HELP."




Panel 1:
Wilbur and a couple of Other Camp Kids (OCK2, OCK3) are standing at the edge of a lake, wearing swim trunks. The lake looks a bit murky.
OCK2: "Last one in is a rotten egg!" (OCK2 and OCK3 jump in with a splash).

Panel 2:
Wilbur hesitantly dips a toe in. His face shows instant regret.
WILBUR: "Whoa! That's... surprisingly warm. And... chunky?"

Panel 3:
OCK2 and OCK3 surface, looking panicked. A very large, cartoonish snapping turtle has OCK2's inflatable swim ring in its mouth.
OCK3: "I think the lake monster wants to play!"

Panel 4:
All three boys are scrambling out of the lake, looking terrified. Wilbur is in the lead.
WILBUR: "Pretty sure 'chunky' means 'full of things that want to eat you!'"




Panel 1:
At an outdoor arts and crafts table. Wilbur and OCK1 (Chip, the nature lover) are supplied with popsicle sticks, glue, and glitter.
OCK1 (Chip): "I shall craft a monument to the forest gods! A tribute to the mighty oak!"

Panel 2:
Wilbur is attempting to build a birdhouse. It's leaning precariously and covered in too much glue.
WILBUR (Muttering): "Okay, tab A into slot B... or is it tab B into slot A... if I even *had* a slot B..."

Panel 3:
Chip proudly holds up his creation: a lopsided blob of popsicle sticks, glitter, and a random leaf, all stuck together.
CHIP: "Behold! The 'Shrine of Eternal Sap'!"

Panel 4:
Wilbur's "birdhouse" has completely collapsed into a sticky, glittery pile. A small, confused-looking squirrel is sniffing it.

WILBUR: "Mine's more of a... 'post-modern interpretation of avian despair.'"




Panel 1:
Visual two kids from camp (OCK4 and OCK5) in a field with cows grazing in the distant background, drawn in cartoonish style. Foreground has the two camp kids, and one is saying:
OCK4: "I'll just put these wires in the cow pie, and then we'll hook the wires up to our generator over there... I heard that the spark between wires should ignite the methane, and then it should go 'Pop'!"

Panel 2:
The wires are hooked up and the kids are walking off panel, the other kid says:
OCK5: "Is this safe?"
OCK4: "Yeah.... the cows are way over there, so they might hear the noise, but I'm sure it'll be fine."

Panel 3:
SFX "BOOM" (where the cowpie was). (nothing else in panel)

Panel 4:
Visual closeup of cows
COW 1 (to COW 2): "What the heck did you eat, Agnes?"


Panel 1:
Mess hall. Wilbur, Chip (OCK1), and OCK2 are staring suspiciously at a greyish lump on their trays.
WILBUR: "Alright, team. Operation: Identify Edible Matter is a go."

Panel 2:
Chip pokes the lump with his fork. It jiggles ominously.
CHIP: "Its texture is... unearthly. Perhaps a new form of sentient fungi?"

Panel 3:
OCK2 bravely takes a tiny bite. His eyes widen in confusion, not necessarily disgust.
OCK2: "It tastes like... disappointment? And maybe old socks?"

Panel 4:
Wilbur is examining the lump with a magnifying glass he inexplicably has.
WILBUR: "Fascinating. The striations suggest... you know what? Let's just call it 'Tuesday surprise' and hope we survive till Wednesday."



Panel 1:
Kids around a (very small, controlled) campfire at night. OCK3 is trying to tell a scary story.
OCK3: "And then... the ghostly camp counselor... reached out with his SPREADSHEET OF DOOM!"

Panel 2:
Wilbur and Chip exchange confused looks.
WILBUR (Whispering to Chip): "Spreadsheet of Doom? Is that scarier than the 'Stapler of Souls'?"

Panel 3:
OCK3 continues, trying to look menacing.
OCK3: "He said... 'Your expense reports are overdue! MWAHAHAHA!'"

Panel 4:
All the kids (including Wilbur) are looking completely baffled, not scared. One kid (OCK5) is yawning.
CHIP: "I think I fear the 'Mystery Meat' more, my friend."




Panel 1:
Wilbur and OCK4 (one of the cow-pie kids) are in a canoe. Wilbur is paddling awkwardly. OCK4 is trying to "steer" by leaning dramatically.
OCK4: "To the uncharted waters, matey! Adventure awaits!"

Panel 2:
They are paddling in very tight circles. Wilbur looks frustrated.
WILBUR: "I think 'uncharted' means 'we haven't left the dock's immediate vicinity yet.'"

Panel 3:
The canoe bumps gently into the dock they just left. A duck on the dock quacks at them, looking judgmental.
DUCK (SFX): "QUACK!"

Panel 4:
Wilbur and OCK4 are back on the dock, looking defeated. The canoe has drifted slightly away by itself.
OCK4: "Well, that was... an efficient exploration of the concept of 'failure.'"
WILBUR: "The duck agrees."



Panel 1:
Wilbur and Chip are sitting outside their cabin, looking at the stars. It's the last night.
WILBUR: "You know, Chip, despite the weird food and near-death experiences, this camp wasn't... entirely awful."

Panel 2:
Chip nods sagely. A raccoon is subtly trying to pick Wilbur's pocket from behind.
CHIP: "Indeed, Wilbur. The wilderness has a way of testing one's spirit... and one's ability to hide cookies."

Panel 3:
Wilbur feels a tug. He looks down to see the raccoon has successfully swiped a half-eaten chocolate bar from his pocket and is scampering off.
WILBUR: "HEY! That was my emergency morale booster!"

Panel 4:
Chip is patting Wilbur on the back. The raccoon is in the background, happily munching.
CHIP: "Consider it a parting gift to the forest spirits, Wilbur. They appreciate chocolate."
WILBUR (Muttering): "I bet they do."



B30-33


Panel 1:
Visual Description: Front hallway or living room of Wilbur's house – a glimpse of homey background.
Wilbur is Standing, profile view, He's still wearing some camping apparel (slightly dirty camp t-shirt, shorts, hiking boots, camp bandana still tied around his head, etc). He has a big, genuine smile. One hand might be raised in an enthusiastic gesture. His eyes are happy dots.
Body Language: Upbeat, energetic pose.
WILBUR (Speech Bubble, enthusiastic font): "Man, it's GREAT to be home!"

Panel 2:
Visual Description: Same as Panel 1, Wilbur has taken a step further into the house.
Wilbur Profile view. He's in the process of shrugging off his backpack. His expression is still pleased, perhaps a little tired but happy.
Backpack: Looks a bit deflated compared to when he was packing for camp.
OFF-PANEL PARENT VOICE (Speech bubble coming from off-panel, standard calm font): "Welcome home, Wilbur! We got a pet for you while you were away. It's in your room."

Panel 3:
Visual Description: Transitioning – Wilbur is at the doorway of his bedroom, just taking a step towards it.
Wilbur's head tilted up slightly with an expression of pure, delighted anticipation.  His mouth is open in a happy gasp. He might be clasping his hands together or have one hand on his chest in a "Oh my gosh!" gesture.
Motion Lines: Slight motion lines indicating he's moving quickly towards his room.
WILBUR (Speech Bubble, very excited, perhaps slightly larger font, maybe with a little bounce to the letters): "A pet! Wow! A pet for ME! I wonder what it is... A puppy? A kitten? A..." (trailing off as he enters his room)

Panel 4:
Visual Description: Inside Wilbur's bedroom. We see a section of his floor.
The "Pet": A single, unremarkable, dark grey or brown stone sits directly in the middle of the visible floor space. It should look very plain. No googly eyes, no leash, just... a rock.
Wilbur is standing just inside the room, in stunned profile view. His body language has completely deflated. Shoulders slumped. His head is tilted down slightly, looking towards the rock. 
WILBUR (Speech Bubble, much smaller, flatter font than Panel 3, a tone of utter letdown): "...a pet rock."


Panel 1: 
Visual description: Wilbur is holding the pet rock contemplatively at arms length (no longer wearing camp bandanna).
WILBUR: "I'm gonna name you Rocky!"

Panel 2:
Visual description: Wilbur's eyes show shock, his entire worldview is being challenged
ROCK: "Rocky?  That's a lame name!  What about something cool like Joe, or Chuck?"

Background: Hint of Wilbur's room (maybe a bit of wall/floor).
Off-Panel Dialogue (Top/Left - Wilbur's voice, agitated/excited):
WILBUR: "MOM! MOM! You won't BELIEVE this! The PET! It TALKED!"
Off-Panel Dialogue (Bottom/Right - Mom's voice, calm, slightly dismissive/patronizing):
MOM: "Oh, did it now, dear? That's... nice."
ROCK (Thought Bubble, small, above it, looking slightly to the side as if trying to hear):
ROCK: "?" or "Huh? What's all the yelling?"

Panel 2
Visual: Same position, center panel. Still just a rock.
Off-Panel Dialogue (Top/Left - Wilbur's voice, insistent, pleading):
WILBUR: "No, really! It said 'Rocky' was a LAME name! It wants to be called Joe or Chuck!"
Off-Panel Dialogue (Bottom/Right - Mom's voice, even more condescending, perhaps a sigh implied):
MOM: "Of course it does, Wilbur. Such an opinionated little pet. Did you use your imagination really hard?"
ROCK (Thought Bubble, above it): "Well, I was not wrong about 'Rocky.'" 

Panel 3
Visual: Rock is in same position
Off-Panel Dialogue (Top/Left - Wilbur's voice, frustrated, desperate):
WILBUR: "But it's TRUE! I'm not making it up! It really, really talked!"
MOM: "Okay, honey. Why don't you and... Chuck... play quietly for a bit while I make dinner? Maybe he'll tell you some more stories."
ROCK: "This lady's a piece of work."

Panel 4
Visual:  Same position, center panel. Alone in the panel. The focus is entirely on its thought.
ROCK: "At least he didn't want to name me Pebbles."



Panel 1:
Setting: Wilbur's living room (where the sofa is). The ROCK is in the middle of the floor, looking like a plain rock.
Wilbur: Enters the panel, perhaps from the left. He looks a bit disheveled or thoughtful after his previous encounter/screaming fit. He sees the rock. His expression could be cautious, or simply resigned.
Body Language: He's not running away anymore, but he's probably not rushing towards the rock either. Maybe a tentative step.
ROCK (Speech Bubble, pointing to rock): "You okay there, sport?" 
WILBUR (Speech Bubble): "Yeah... yeah, I'm okay." (A bit hesitant).

Panel 2:
Wilbur: Now sitting on the sofa. He could be slumped a bit, or sitting upright but staring blankly ahead or at the rock. His large nose might be prominent as he's in thought.
Rock: Still on the floor, perhaps angled slightly as if "looking" towards Wilbur on the sofa.
Body Language (Wilbur): A mix of acceptance and bewilderment. Maybe one hand rubbing his forehead or chin.
WILBUR: "So... you can talk. That's... new." (Delivered with a sense of weary understatement).

Panel 3:
Wilbur: Still on the sofa. His reaction to the rock's statement is surprise.
ROCK (Speech Bubble, confident, perhaps slightly matter-of-fact font): "Oh, we can ALL talk. Most of us just don't usually have much to say, y'know? Pretty boring, being a rock.  What's there to talk about? Erosion? Good sediment these days?"


Panel 4:
Wilbur: Still on the sofa, but now turned slightly to look AT THE READER. His expression is one of complete exasperation, resignation, and "can you believe this?" appeal to the audience. This is where his large nose might be pointing right out of the panel.
Rock: Still on the floor, perhaps looking perfectly content or oblivious to Wilbur's existential crisis.
Body Language (Wilbur): Could have his hands thrown up in a small gesture of "what can you do?" or one hand on his forehead.
WILBUR (Speech Bubble, clearly addressing the reader): "My life is SO weird." 

B34

Panel 1:
Visual Description: Tom and Crewcut are standing outside a generic-looking shop (e.g., "Ye Olde Curiosity Shoppe"). Tom is holding a slightly delicate, perhaps ornate, garden gnome or a small, decorative birdbath in his hands. Crewcut, being taller, looms over him slightly.
Dialogue:
TOM: "Hey, Crewcut, can you just keep an eye on this for me for a sec? I gotta run back inside, forgot my wallet."

Panel 2:
Visual Description: Tom is gone, presumably back into the shop. Crewcut is now holding the garden gnome/birdbath firmly in both hands. He is staring at it intently, his large nose almost touching it. One dot eye is squinting in concentration, as if trying to discern something. He looks extremely focused.
Dialogue:
CREWCUT (Thought Bubble, earnest, very focused): "Hmm. Needs more... vigilance."

Panel 3:
Visual Description: Tom has just exited the shop, wallet in hand. He sees Crewcut. Crewcut is now trying to carefully balance a single, comically large, realistic-looking glass eyeball (like a prop from a novelty store) directly on top of the garden gnome's head or the rim of the birdbath. He's concentrating hard, tongue slightly out.
Dialogue:
TOM: "Crewcut! What are you doing?!"

Panel 4:
Visual Description: Wider shot. The garden gnome/birdbath is now completely obscured by a ridiculous pile of various "eyes": several large googly eyes, a smaller pile of tiny googly eyes, maybe a couple of cartoonishly drawn fake eyeballs, and perhaps even a potato with multiple googly eyes stuck onto it. Crewcut is standing proudly next to it, wiping his hands together with a satisfied expression. Tom is beside him, his dot eyes now wide with a white circle of complete shock, possibly with his jaw dropped or hands thrown up in despair.
Dialogue:
CREWCUT: "Just helping it 'keep an eye out,' like you asked! Now it's got all the eyes it needs! Very watchful!"
TOM (Speech Bubble, small, exasperated, maybe a faint "Sigh"): "You are... impossible."

B35-B38

Panel 1:
Setting: Outdoors, nighttime, stars in sky.
Visual: Julie standing, looking straight up at a starry sky. A few stars visible. Her expression is one of mild enjoyment.
Julie (Thought Bubble): "Stargazing is so much fun!"

Panel 2:
Visual: Julie still looking up, but now with a slight strain in her eyes/face. She's trying to look down, but her head isn't moving.
Julie (Thought Bubble): "Okay, peace out, stars. Time to..."
SFX (small): creak?

Panel 3:
Visual: Wider shot. Julie is definitively stuck looking straight up. A look of dawning horror/panic on her face.
Julie (Thought Bubble): "Uh oh. I think... I think I'm stuck like this!"

Panel 4:
Visual: Close-up on Julie's face (still looking up). A small bird has landed on her nose, chirping happily, facing the sky with her.
Julie (Thought Bubble): "Well, this is just great."
Bird (Chirp Bubble): "Chirp!" 


Panel 1:
Visual: Julie still stuck looking up. In the background, a small, classic UFO with landing lights descends.
Julie (Thought Bubble): "Could this night get any weirder?"

Panel 2:
Visual: UFO has landed. Two small aliens (circular heads, antennae, regular-sized noses) are disembarking, looking towards Julie.
Alien 1: "Zilgazar, Our intel was correct. The dominant species is here to welcome us."

Panel 3:
Visual: Aliens closer to Julie, looking up at her face (we see her from their lower perspective). Julie looks surprised/confused.
Alien 2 (to Alien 1): "They do seem exceptionally eager for our glorious return, Zerk."

Panel 4:
Visual: The two aliens are looking at each other, puzzled. Julie is in the background, still staring skyward.
Alien 1: "Though, I am a bit surprised they didn't give their necks a rest for the occasion."
Julie (Thought Bubble): "You and me both, pal."



Panel 1:
Visual: Wilbur walks onto the panel, sees Julie standing rigidly, staring at the sky. He looks confused.
Wilbur: "Julie? What are you doing?"
Julie (strained, still looking up): "Admiring the... uh... cloud formations, Wilbur."

Panel 2:
Visual: Wilbur stands in front of her, looking up at her face.
Wilbur: "Are you okay? Can you still look at people?"
Julie (Thought Bubble): "Good question."

Panel 3:
Visual: Julie bends over sharply at the waist, bringing her face (still pointing "up" relative to her body) down to Wilbur's eye level. She's now in a comical "L" shape. Wilbur looks startled.
Julie: "Well, if I do this... sort of."

Panel 4:
Visual: Julie, still bent over, has a contemplative look (as much as possible). Wilbur looks on, bewildered.
Julie: "You know, maybe I should try out for the school play. I think I'd be a shoo-in for 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame'."



Panel 1:
Setting: Doctor's waiting room
Visual: Julie (still neck stuck up, looking miserable) and Tom are in a doctor's waiting room. Tom looks concerned but reassuring.
Tom: "Don't worry, Julie. The doctor will take care of everything."
Nurse (Off-panel speech bubble): "Julie Peters?"

Panel 2:
Visual: Julie is walking towards a doorway (to the exam room), her head still pointing skyward. 
Tom (from off-panel): "You'll be back to normal in no time!"

Panel 3:
Visual: Tom is alone in the waiting room, wincing and covering his ears with his hands. Massive, chaotic sound effects emanate from the off-panel exam room.
SFX (large, overlapping): GRAB! TWIST! YANK! REVOLVE! CRRRANK! "EEEEEYOOOOOUCH!!!"

Panel 4:
Visual: Julie walks out of the exam room, her neck is back to normal, but her hair is disheveled, and she looks dazed and slightly traumatized. Tom looks at her with wide, expectant eyes.
Julie: "Tom... is a crescent wrench an approved medical instrument?"

B39-B42


Panel 1:
Visual Description: A fluffy white cloud drifts casually.
CLOUD 1: "Nice breeze today."

Panel 2:
Visual Description: A smaller, wispy cloud drifts by Cloud 1.
CLOUD 2: "Hard to enjoy it when you're always being judged."

Panel 3:
CLOUD 1: "Judged? By whom?"

Panel 4:
Visual Description: zoom out.  Cloud 2 is now revealed to be near a weather vane, which is pointing accusingly at it.
CLOUD 2: "The all-seeing chicken."



Panel 1: Junior is kneeling intently, nose almost touching a blade of grass. Tom stands behind him, arms crossed, looking weary.
JUNIOR: "The inherent chlorophyll structure of C4 plants, while efficient, presents an evolutionary anomaly."
TOM: "..."

Panel 2: Junior has a tiny microscope attached to a headband, peering at the grass.
JUNIOR: "The very shade of green implies a deeper, possibly extraterrestrial, significance that we have failed to fully appreciate!"

Panel 3: Junior stands triumphantly, holding up a complex diagram filled with arrows and equations. Tom looks confused.
JUNIOR: "My calculations suggest that 'green' is merely a psychological construct imposed by the solar spectrum's inherent bias!"

Panel 4: Junior proudly holds up a dull, brownish-grey blade of grass. Tom squints at it.
JUNIOR: "This, Tom, is its true, unfiltered form!"
TOM: "Junior, that's just dead grass."




Panel 1: Julie is standing outside, looking at Wilbur with a gentle smile, about to say something sweet.
JULIE (Thought Bubble): "Okay, deep breath. You can do this."
JULIE (Speaking): "Wilbur, you're so..."

Panel 2: As Julie begins to blush, a tiny, personal cloud appears directly over her head, and it begins to rain only on her. Wilbur looks slightly confused, but dry.
JULIE: "Hey!" (Looks up, soaked).

Panel 3: Julie is now dripping wet, looking exasperated. Wilbur looks up at the sky, unaffected.
WILBUR: "Oh, is it raining? I didn't feel anything."
JULIE (Dripping wet, fuming): "OF COURSE YOU DIDN'T!"

Panel 4: Julie stalks off, leaving a trail of puddles. Wilbur watches her slightly confused.
JULIE (Thought Bubble, small, defeated): "The universe absolutely hates me."



Panel 1: Wilbur walks past a fire hydrant, looking glum and dejected.
FIRE HYDRANT (Thought Bubble): "Ah, young love. So complicated. He clearly needs guidance."

Panel 2: Wilbur sits on a nearby bench, staring into space. The fire hydrant is still in the foreground, seeming to "observe" him.
FIRE HYDRANT (Thought Bubble): "He needs to play hard to get. Make her wonder. Ignite the spark of curiosity."

Panel 3: Julie walks into the panel, sees Wilbur on the bench, and sighs, then turns and walks away. The fire hydrant looks dismayed.
FIRE HYDRANT (Thought Bubble): "No, no, too hard. Now she's leaving! He's already lost her!"

Panel 4: The fire hydrant lets out a dramatic sigh (represented by a tiny "PFFFT" sound effect). Wilbur remains on the bench, oblivious.
FIRE HYDRANT (Thought Bubble): "Just go up to her and say 'hello,' kid. It's not rocket science. Literally not rocket science."

B43-56

Panel 1: Wilbur and Tom are talking in what looks like a normal, well-composed panel.
WILBUR: "I hate it when the artist puts too much empty space in the first panel. It's just bad pacing."
TOM: "Wilbur, that's literally never happened."

Panel 2: Panel is now almost entirely blank, with Wilbur and Tom as tiny figures in the bottom corner, squinting up at the vast empty space.
WILBUR: "See?!"
TOM (Small, confused): "Okay, that's just... unnecessary."

Panel 3: Panel is now completely filled with intricate, tiny details – a massive, cluttered background, multiple tiny, extraneous characters, a labyrinth of lines. Wilbur and Tom are squeezed into a tiny corner.
WILBUR: "Or when they overcompensate and cram too much in!"
TOM (Squinting, overwhelmed): "My eyes hurt."

Panel 4: Normal panel composition again. Wilbur and Tom look relieved. 
WILBUR: "I stand by my critique."



Panel 1: Wilbur is standing in front of a vending machine, trying to cajole it.
WILBUR: "Come on, just one little snack. I know you want to dispense something tasty."

Panel 2: Vending Machine (Thought Bubble): "No, I don't. I'm full. And I'm judging your snack choices."

Panel 3: Wilbur gives the machine a gentle kick.
WILBUR: "Just a little nudge, then."
VENDING MACHINE (Thought Bubble): "Physical abuse! I'm calling my lawyer! And I'm filing a grievance with the Snack Dispenser's Union!"

Panel 4: The vending machine violently self-destructs in an explosion of springs, candy wrappers, and soda cans. A single, tiny bag of peanuts floats gently to the ground. Wilbur stares, wide-eyed.
WILBUR: "Well, that was... extreme. For peanuts."




Panel 1: Junior is crouched intently over a small puddle on the sidewalk, holding a magnifying glass. Tom looks over his shoulder, confused.

JUNIOR: "This aqueous anomaly defies conventional hydrological models. Its implications are profound."
TOM: "It's a puddle, Junior. It rained."

Panel 2: Junior is now collecting tiny samples into multiple vials, looking utterly serious.
JUNIOR: "Observe the intricate micro-organisms engaging in complex socio-economic structures within their liquid metropolis!"

Panel 3: Zoom into the puddle: tiny, cartoon bacteria are visible, wearing suits and ties, shaking hands, and building minuscule skyscrapers. One even has a briefcase.
JUNIOR (Off-panel): "A vibrant ecosystem thriving beneath our very feet!"

Panel 4: Tom is now crouched beside Junior, peering into the puddle with a look of stunned disbelief. Junior points proudly.
TOM: "I... I stand corrected."
JUNIOR: "Naturally."




Panel 1: Junior sits at the kitchen table, an open cereal box in front of him. He has a tiny notepad and pencil.
JUNIOR: "Today, I investigate the aerodynamics of breakfast flakes."

Panel 2: Junior launches a single cereal flake into the air with a tiny catapult. It wobbles.
JUNIOR: "Sub-optimal lift-to-drag ratio. Predicted."

Panel 3: The cereal flake lands directly in Wilbur's open mouth (who just walked into the frame, yawning). Wilbur looks surprised.
WILBUR: "Hey! Free snack!"

Panel 4: Junior is furiously writing notes. Wilbur shrugs, chewing.
JUNIOR: "Unforeseen variable: The Human Oral Vortex. Must revise all calculations."



Panel 1: Wilbur tries to sit on the living room sofa. A cushion beneath him subtly shifts away.
WILBUR: "Time for some TV."

Panel 2: Wilbur attempts to sit. The cushion immediately pops out from under him, sending him sprawling on the floor.
SFX: "BOING!" "THUD!"

Panel 3: Wilbur glares at the cushion, which appears to be smirking.
CUSHION (Thought Bubble): "Not today, human. This is my comfort zone."

Panel 4: Wilbur is sitting rigidly upright on the bare sofa frame, avoiding the cushion. The cushion is sitting perfectly on the floor next to the sofa, looking quite content.
WILBUR: "Fine. Be that way."
CUSHION (Thought Bubble): "Victory!"






Panel 1: Wilbur is sweeping his messy room. A large, fluffy dust bunny sits in a corner, watching him.
WILBUR: "Time to tame this dust jungle."

Panel 2: Wilbur sweeps past the dust bunny.
DUST BUNNY (Thought Bubble, disdainful): "Amateur. You missed a spot. And another."

Panel 3: Wilbur gathers a pile of dust. The dust bunny sighs dramatically.
DUST BUNNY (Thought Bubble, exasperated): "The sheer audacity of these humans, disturbing our perfectly formed ecosystems."

Panel 4: Wilbur proudly holds up his dustpan, full of collected dust. The dust bunny has grown considerably larger, now sitting squarely in the middle of the room, staring at him.
WILBUR: "Done!"
DUST BUNNY (Thought Bubble, with an implied eye-roll): "Cute. Now about those crumbs under the rug..."




Panel 1: Wilbur opens the refrigerator door, looking for a snack.
WILBUR: "Anything good in here?"

Panel 2: Refrigerator (Thought Bubble): "You know there's only leftover broccoli. And that questionable casserole."

Panel 3: Wilbur reaches inside.
REFRIGERATOR (Thought Bubble): "Don't you dare. That's for my emergency stash."

Panel 4: Wilbur is zapped with a small, harmless bolt of electricity, recoiling. The refrigerator door is shut, glowing slightly.
WILBUR: "Ow! Did the fridge just... shock me?"
REFRIGERATOR (Thought Bubble): "Mine."



Panel 1: Junior is sitting on the grass, intently observing an ant colony. He has a tiny clipboard.
JUNIOR: "Today, I study the intricate social hierarchies of formicidae."

Panel 2: Zoom into the ants: a tiny ant wearing a crown is being fanned by other ants, while another ant is pulling a tiny wagon full of crumbs.
ANT QUEEN (Thought Bubble): "More grapes! And fewer distractions!"

Panel 3: Junior looks up from his notes, surprised. A tiny ant wearing a tiny construction hat walks up and angrily taps Junior's clipboard.
ANT WORKER (Tiny Speech Bubble): "Hey! We're on break! No more notes!"

Panel 4: Junior is now frantically sketching, looking overwhelmed. The ants are having a tiny union meeting, picketing with tiny signs ("Fair Crumbs!" "No Overtime!").
JUNIOR: "Fascinating! A workers' revolution! This changes everything!"






Panel 1: Wilbur is standing in a large, empty room, experimenting.
WILBUR: "Hello? Is anyone there?"

Panel 2: An echo returns, but it's not just his voice. 
ECHO (Speech Bubble, slightly wavy font): "Hello? Is anyone there?"

Panel 3: Wilbur tries again.
WILBUR: "Just my echo, then."
ECHO: "Just my echo, then. [beat] You wish. I have opinions!"

Panel 4: Wilbur is slumped back against a cliff wall, eyes rolling upwards.
ECHO: "And your posture is terrible! Also, you should try broccoli!"
WILBUR: "My echo is judging my life choices."



Panel 1: Wilbur is walking down the street at night near a lampost 
WILBUR: "Hmm, that light's a bit on the fritz."

Panel 2: The streetlight flickers brightly, then dims, then goes out completely.
SFX: POOF!
STREETLIGHT (Thought Bubble): "Oh, really? I hadn't noticed. It's not like I illuminate the entire block or anything."

Panel 3: Wilbur tries to kicking the pole to no avail
STREETLIGHT (Thought Bubble, with an implied eye-roll): "Such insightful maintenance."

Panel 4: Wilbur walks away in the dark. The streetlight remains off.
WILBUR: "I think it's mad at me."
STREETLIGHT (Thought Bubble): "Enjoy the trip, buttercup."



Panel 1: Junior is peering intently into a clothes dryer that's running. Tom looks puzzled.
JUNIOR: "The phenomenon of the missing sock: not a laundry mishap, but a topological anomaly."

Panel 2: Junior has diagrams of theoretical physics. The dryer hums.
JUNIOR: "My hypothesis suggests a localized micro-wormhole, specifically calibrated for single socks."

Panel 3: A single sock tumbles out of the dryer, then immediately disappears into a tiny, shimmering vortex that opens and closes on the floor.
SOCK (Tiny Speech Bubble, panicked): "NOOOOOO!"
TOM: "Whoa!"

Panel 4: Junior is furiously writing notes, looking ecstatic. Tom stares at the spot where the sock vanished.
JUNIOR: "Confirmed! It's a trans-dimensional portal!"
TOM: "But... what about the sock's other sock?"


Panel 1: A lone orange traffic cone sits on the side of a road.
TRAFFIC CONE (Thought Bubble): "Another day. Another reminder of humanity's chaotic tendencies."

Panel 2: A car drives slightly too close, nudging the cone.
TRAFFIC CONE (Thought Bubble): "The endless disregard for my personal space. The lack of respect for my authority."

Panel 3: Wilbur walks by and accidentally knocks the cone over.
TRAFFIC CONE (Thought Bubble): "Barbarians! My noble lineage of orange plastic! Desecrated!"

Panel 4: The cone is lying on its side. It has a tiny, comically tearful eye and a single tear drop.
TRAFFIC CONE (Thought Bubble): "I am a beacon of order! A sentinel of safety! And I am... broken."



Panel 1: Tom looks completely stressed out, almost unraveling. Crewcut approaches.
TOM: "Ugh, I just need to pull myself together."

Panel 2: Crewcut grabs Tom by the arms and starts literally trying to pull him into a tighter, more compact shape. Tom looks horrified.
CREWCUT (Serious): "Initiating compaction sequence."

Panel 3: Tom is now crumpled into a tiny, neat ball, looking dazed. Crewcut looks satisfied.
TOM: "Mph... Crewcut... mmpff!"

Panel 4: Crewcut gently sets the crumpled Tom down.
CREWCUT: "There. All pulled together. Very efficient."
TOM (Still a ball): "I hate you sometimes."


Panel 1: A large, fluffy white cloud drifts along peacefully.
CLOUD 1: "Ah, the simple joys of existence. Drifting. Being."

Panel 2: A smaller, darker cloud drifts by, looking troubled.
CLOUD 2: "But what is 'being,' really? Are we merely moisture coalescing, or do we possess a deeper purpose?"

Panel 3: Cloud 1 looks disturbed. Cloud 2 continues.
CLOUD 1: "Woah, easy there, buddy."
CLOUD 2: "Is our form truly ephemeral, or do we persist in some ethereal, vaporous afterlife?"

Panel 4: Cloud 1 has turned into a tiny, nervous rain cloud. Cloud 2 has turned into a massive, existential storm cloud, pouring rain.
CLOUD 1 (Tiny, panicking): "Stop it! You're making me cry!"
CLOUD 2 (Massive, thundering): "DOES MY EXISTENCE HAVE MEANING?!"



Panel 1: Junior is in a park, observing a squirrel. He has a clipboard.
JUNIOR: "The common tree squirrel, while seemingly benign, presents an intriguing case study in urban adaptation."

Panel 2: The squirrel is frantically burying an acorn. Junior is taking notes.
SQUIRREL (Thought Bubble, stressed): "Got to hide it! Got to hide it! The winter is coming! And those little humans are always watching!"

Panel 3: Junior points to a second, much larger, more muscular squirrel in the background, who is wearing a tiny "BOSS" t-shirt and appears to be intimidating smaller squirrels.
JUNIOR: "Ah, fascinating! Evidence of a dominant alpha variant, possibly a 'Boss Squirrel,' controlling resource allocation!"

Panel 4: The "Boss Squirrel" is now flexing its tiny muscles, glaring at Junior. Junior is excitedly sketching.
BOSS SQUIRREL (Speech Bubble, gruff): "squeak squeak squeak!*"  (*You got a problem, kid? Mind your own business!)
JUNIOR: "I'm not sure, but I think it's agitated by my presence"


Panel 1:
Setting: Wilbur’s bathroom.
Visual: Wilbur, disheveled, stares at himself in the mirror. Toothbrush in mouth.
WILBUR: “Ugh. I look like I fought a mop and lost.”
MIRROR (Thought Bubble): “Incorrect. The mop had better posture.”

Panel 2:
Wilbur brushes harder, scowling.
WILBUR: “Don’t judge me, morning face.”
MIRROR (Thought Bubble): “I reflect. You project.”

Panel 3:
Wilbur sticks a happy-face sticky note over the mirror.
WILBUR: “There. Fixed.”
MIRROR (Thought Bubble): “Denial. Strong choice.”

Panel 4:
Wilbur walks off. Sticky note peels halfway off.
MIRROR (Thought Bubble): “We’ll meet again, scruffy one.”


Panel 1:
Setting: Wilbur’s bedroom, pre-dawn. Alarm clock reads 6:59.
Wilbur lies asleep, snoring peacefully.
ALARM CLOCK (Thought Bubble): “Peaceful. Tragic.”

Panel 2:
SFX: “BWAAAAP!!”
Wilbur flails upright in bed, hair wild.
WILBUR: “Wha—? I was flying on a grilled cheese!”

Panel 3:
Wilbur glares at the clock, dazed and angry.
WILBUR: “I think you actually hate me.”
ALARM CLOCK (Thought Bubble): “My only regret... is mercy.”

Panel 4:
Wilbur pulls a pillow over his head.
ALARM CLOCK (Thought Bubble): “We begin again tomorrow.”






B60-62

Another arc involves Junior, excited to go to kindergarten:


Panel 1: Wilbur looking at a calendar, and remarks that summer is almost over.
Panel 2: zoom out a little bit, Junior is  beside him.  Wilbur tells him that he's going to kindergarten
Panel 3: Junior: (panel centered only on him) "Me?  Go to kindergarten?" (thinking out loud)
Panel 4: (panel shows both Wilbur and Junior again same spacing as panel 2) Junior looks directly at his brother and says "I can't wait to learn Latin!"

Panel 1: Junior is surrounded by a bunch of nameless books, and Wilbur walks on panel asks him what he's doing.
Panel 2: Junior says "Studying for Kindergarten"
Panel 3: Wilbur says that you don't study for Kindergarten.   Junior disappointedly says You dont?
Panel 4: Centered entirely on Junior, "All that time wasted... mastering the Quadratic Formula... deciphering the Theory of Relativity... memorizing the Periodic Table of Elements... outlining the Geopolitical Implications of the Peloponnesian War... and for what?!"

Panel 1: Wilbur is walking with his brother (left to right), they are dressed in fall clothing, both are wearing toques.  Wilbur says "That's the school, that's where you go to Kindergarten."
Panel 2: Wilbur stands still with a surprised expression, while his brother runs off panel so fast that his toque is still in place, rapid motion lines leaning off panel to the right.  Off panel shout "Woohoo!"
Panel 3: Wilbur is coverign his eyes, and off panel to the right is a sound effect: WHAM!
Panel 4: Junior walks back on panel from the right, looks at this brother a bit dazed and says "Nobody said anything about a door."

B63-B67

Panel 1:
Visual Description: Wilbur's living room. Wilbur is on the sofa, looking slightly bored or distracted. A plain, black, rectangular TV is visible only from its side profile (no screen visible). Chuck the Rock is positioned on the floor directly in front of the TV, directly in front of the screen.
WILBUR: "Still watching that documentary, Chuck?"
CHUCK: "Shhh! It's getting to the good part."

Panel 2:
Visual Description: Close-up on Chuck. 
CHUCK: "They're about to make history!"

Panel 3:
Visual Description: Focus on the area around the TV (still side view). The sound effects from the TV are more prominent.
TV: "...and with the release of their groundbreaking album 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,' The Beatles cemented their place as the greatest rock group of all time!"
SFX (from TV): <APPLAUSE>

Panel 4:
Visual Description: Wider shot of the living room. Wilbur is now turned fully towards Chuck, his dot eyes wide with bewildered exasperation (perhaps a white circle of shock around one eye). His mouth is slightly agape. Chuck is still serenely focused on the TV. The TV remains in side profile.
Dialogue:
WILBUR: "Wait... you've been watching a documentary about music?!"
CHUCK: "Naturally! The most iconic rock group in history!"


Panel 1:
Visual Description: Wilbur standing on a step stool, intently trying to change a lightbulb. 
WILBUR: "Just need to twist this clockwise... or is it counter-clockwise?"

Panel 2:
Visual Description: Wilbur falls off the stool with a yelp, arms flailing. The lightbulb is still intact in his hand.
SFX: "WHOOPS!" "CRASH!"
Panel 3:
Visual Description: Wilbur is on the floor, looking annoyed. The light fixture itself has twisted off the ceiling and is dangling by its wires.
WILBUR: "Well, that didn't go as planned."

Panel 4:
Visual Description: Wilbur is now trying to duct tape the light fixture back onto the ceiling. It looks precariously attached.
WILBUR (Thought Bubble): "At least it's stuck. Ish."


Panel 1:
Visual Description: Wilbur is looking intently at a common houseplant. He has a magnifying glass.
WILBUR: "Hmm. Fascinating cellular structure."

Panel 2:
Visual Description: Close-up on the plant. A tiny spider is visibly waving a tiny white flag at Wilbur, an expression of exasperation on its tiny face.
SFX: "SURRENDER!" (tiny lettering)

Panel 3:
Visual Description: Wilbur backs away slightly, looking thoughtful.
WILBUR: "Perhaps my investigative methods are too... intrusive."

Panel 4:
Visual Description: Wilbur is now drawing the plant and spider in a notebook, completely missing the spider's plea.
WILBUR (Thought Bubble): "Note to self: acquire smaller magnifying glass."


Panel 1:
Visual Description: Wilbur stands proudly next to a crudely built contraption made of cardboard, string, and tin cans.
WILBUR: "Behold! My latest invention: The Automatic Homework Dispenser!"

Panel 2:
Visual Description: Wilbur pulls a string. The contraption rattles and a single, crumpled piece of paper falls out.
SFX: "CLUNK! RATTLE!" "PLOP!"

Panel 3:
Visual Description: Wilbur picks up the crumpled paper. It's a drawing of a smiling dog.
WILBUR (Confused): "Huh. I thought I put in the math equations."

Panel 4:
Visual Description: Junior walks by, holding a neat stack of math homework.
JUNIOR: "That's why I do mine manually, Wilbur. Less chance of canine-related algebraic contamination."



Panel 1:
Visual Description: Wilbur is in his bedroom, looking at a wall, perhaps scratching his head.
WILBUR (Thought Bubble): "I wonder if Chuck knows anything about why all my socks keep disappearing in the dryer."

Panel 2:
Visual Description: Cut to Chuck the Rock on the floor in the living room, next to a pile of single, mismatched socks. He has a satisfied look.
CHUCK (Thought Bubble): "Those fabric softeners are getting better. Makes the texture so much more absorbent."

Panel 3:
Visual Description: Back to Wilbur, who sighs.
WILBUR: "Probably just a cosmic mystery."

Panel 4:
Visual Description: Chuck, now wearing a tiny sock on his "head" (top part).
CHUCK (Thought Bubble): "And the acoustics are perfect for naptime."


Panel 1:
Visual: Wilbur is in the bathroom, holding a toothbrush in one hand and a large turkey baster in the other. His expression is one of intense, misguided innovation.
WILBUR (proudly): “No more squeezing tubes! This is science, baby.”

Panel 2:
Visual: Close-up as Wilbur dips the turkey baster into a massive, half-empty tube of toothpaste.
WILBUR (muttering): “Just a clean suction draw… precision application…”
SFX: SQUISH

Panel 3:
Visual: The baster suddenly explodes toothpaste everywhere — across Wilbur’s face, mirror, and ceiling. He looks stunned, mouth slightly open, brush still untouched.
SFX: FWUMP! SPLOOSH!
WILBUR: “...That may have been... slightly over-engineered.”

Panel 4:
Visual: Junior passes the bathroom doorway, barely glancing in. Wilbur is covered in toothpaste foam, the turkey baster stuck in his collar.
JUNIOR (flatly): “Or underbrained.”
WILBUR (calmly): “Criticism noted.”

B69-74


Panel 1
Visual Description:
Setting: Wilbur's living room or a neutral shared space in the house.
Wilbur: Standing, perhaps looking slightly serious or like he's about to impart important news. He might be looking down at Junior.
Junior: Looking up at Wilbur, attentive.
Body Language: Wilbur might have his hands on his hips or one hand gesturing slightly. Junior is just listening.
WILBUR: "Junior, Mom and Dad wanted me to tell you... Mom's going to have a baby soon."

Panel 2
Visual Description:
Setting: Same.
Wilbur: Might look a little relieved he got the initial announcement out, or perhaps slightly apprehensive about the inevitable questions.
Junior: His expression is starting to shift from simple attentiveness to thoughtful processing. Perhaps a slight head tilt, eyes looking up and to the side as if accessing data. His large-nosed profile would be good here.
Body Language: Junior might put a finger to his chin or temple.
JUNIOR: "A baby? How does that... manifest? Where does it come from?"
WILBUR: (Slightly hesitant, trying to simplify) "Well... it grows inside Mom's tummy."

Panel 3
Visual Description:
Setting: Same.
Wilbur: Looks increasingly uncomfortable or like he's chosen his words poorly. Maybe a small sweat drop.
Junior: Now looking directly at Wilbur, his expression is one of intense focus, like he's connecting complex data points. His eyes might be narrowed in concentration.
Body Language: Junior might take a small step closer, or lean in slightly.
JUNIOR: "Her tummy? Where she puts her ingested sustenance for metabolic processing?"
WILBUR: (Waving a hand dismissively, trying to correct course) "Uh... yeah, kind of... but it's different! The baby just... grows there."

Panel 4
Visual Description:
Setting: Same.
Wilbur: Full-blown shock/facepalm/eyes wide in disbelief. His whole body might be recoiling slightly. His large nose could be pointing straight up in exasperation.
Junior: Standing perfectly still, looking up at Wilbur with an expression of genuine, earnest inquiry. He truly believes he's asking a logical follow-up question.
Body Language: Junior is calm, Wilbur is not.
JUNIOR: "Okay. So... why did Mom eat the baby in the first place?"


Panel 1
Visual Description:
Setting: Living room or Wilbur's room – a familiar home setting.
Wilbur: On a landline phone. He should look happy and excited, a genuine smile. Maybe one hand gesturing positively.
Body Language: Upbeat, pleased.
WILBUR (into phone): "That's great news, Dad! Awesome! Okay, see you soon!"

Panel 2
Visual Description:
Setting: Same as Panel 1. Wilbur has just hung up the phone or is lowering it.
Wilbur: Turning towards Junior (who has now entered the panel or was already there, perhaps looking curious about the call). Wilbur's expression is still happy and excited, eager to share.
Junior: Looking up at Wilbur, attentive, perhaps with a slight head tilt of curiosity.
Body Language: Wilbur is open and enthusiastic. Junior is receptive, but we haven't seen his full processing yet.
WILBUR: "That was Dad from the hospital, Junior! Mom had the baby – it's a girl! We get to meet our new sister, Marcy, tonight!"


Panel 3
Visual Description:
Setting: Same.
Wilbur: Kneeling down slightly to be more on Junior's level, or at least leaning in, putting a hand on Junior's shoulder perhaps. His expression is warm, trying to make this a special moment for Junior.
Junior: Looking directly at Wilbur. His expression is starting to shift – no longer just curious, but more thoughtful, processing this new role. His eyes might be slightly wider or more focused.
Body Language: Wilbur is trying to be reassuring and inclusive. Junior is absorbing the information.
WILBUR: "And guess what? That means you get to be a big brother now, too!"
JUNIOR (Small speech bubble, or just slightly smaller font, contemplative): "A... big brother?"

Panel 4
Visual Description:
Setting: Close-up, centered entirely on JUNIOR. The background can be a simple color wash or very blurred to keep focus.
Junior:
Expression: A wide, almost manic grin.
Eyebrows: Angled sharply downwards in classic "angry" or "scheming" cartoon eyebrows.
Eyes: Could be wide and gleaming, or narrowed slightly with his grin.
"Ghost" Devil Horns: Faint, translucent, classic pointy devil horns appearing above his head. They shouldn't be solid, more like a comedic visual representation of his sudden thought process.


Panel 1
Visual: The front door of the house opening inwards. We only see DAD'S legs and feet stepping in, carefully carrying a baby carrier. Wilbur is peeking around the corner, a mix of excitement and apprehension. Junior is standing further back, arms possibly crossed, looking analytical.
DAD (Off-panel, warm & happy): "Okay, careful now... precious cargo coming through!"
WILBUR (Thought Bubble): "New sister! Hope she doesn't cry as much as Aunt Mildred's poodle..."

Panel 2
Visual: The baby carrier is now placed on the floor. Wilbur is cautiously approaching it. Junior walks up beside him, peering down with intense focus.
JUNIOR: "The specimen has arrived. Based on gestational averages, I anticipate a mass of approximately 3.4 kilograms and a vocal output primarily in the 250-500 Hz range upon stimulation."
WILBUR: "It's a baby, Junior, not a science experiment."

Panel 3
Visual: Closer shot. DAD's hands (only hands visible) are fumbling slightly with the buckles of the baby carrier. A tiny, almost imperceptible squeak or gurgle comes from it. Wilbur is leaning in very close, nose almost touching the carrier. Junior is taking out a tiny notepad and pencil (a recurring prop for him perhaps?).
DAD (Off-panel, slightly flustered): "These new-fangled buckles... almost got it..."
SFX (from carrier, very faint): eep!
WILBUR (Whispering): "I think it moved!"
JUNIOR (Muttering to himself, writing): "Observation: Subject exhibits minimal auditory response to environmental stimuli..."

Panel 4
Visual: MARCY'S REVEAL. Dad's hands lift MARCY out of the carrier.
She looks exactly like Junior in the face (same large nose, same dot eyes).
She has prominent pigtails.
Her head is HUGE in proportion to her tiny body.
Wilbur's jaw is on the floor, eyes wide in utter disbelief. His whole body might be frozen mid-lean.
Junior has stopped writing, pencil frozen mid-air. His eyes are wide (for Junior). He's staring, a look of pure, analytical shock.
MOM (Off-panel): "There she is! Our little Marcy."
Wilbur's tiny thought bubble) "It's... another Junior! With... bows?!"


Panel 1
Visual: Mom (only arms/hands visible, maybe holding Marcy, or Marcy is propped up in a baby seat on the sofa) is now in the scene. Wilbur and Junior are still looking at Marcy with a degree of stunned silence. Marcy is looking around with wide, dot eyes.
WILBUR (Stammering slightly): "She... uh... she definitely has the family nose."

Panel 2
Visual: Close up on Junior looking intently at Marcy. Marcy might be looking back at him, a mirror image (minus pigtails, plus extreme proportions).
JUNIOR: "Fascinating. The phenotypic resemblance is undeniable. A near-perfect replication, albeit with a distinct cranial-to-somatic ratio variance and an added follicular adornment."
MARCY (SFX): hic! 

Panel 3
Visual: Wilbur is tentatively reaching a finger out towards Marcy (who might be in Mom's arms or a seat). Marcy's tiny hand reaches out and unexpectedly grabs his finger with surprising strength for a baby.
WILBUR: "Ooh! Hey there, Marcy..."
SFX (from Marcy's grip): grip! (small, but implies surprising strength)

Panel 4
Visual: Wilbur's eyes are wide with surprise at the strength of her grip. Marcy is looking pleased with herself, still holding his finger. Junior is observing this interaction with keen interest.
WILBUR (Thought Bubble): "Strong grip for a baby... or a tiny, pigtail-wearing clone of Junior."
JUNIOR (Thought Bubble): "Noteworthy prehensile capabilities. Potential for early development of advanced manual dexterity?"


Panel 1: visual: wilbur and marcy are in panel, wilburs kees are bent forward so as to bring his face closer to his level, he is looking at marcy.
WILBUR: "Hey Marcy, look!"

Panel 2: visual: Wilbur puts his hands behind his ears to push them outward
WILBUR: "Eek gook baa baa!"

Panel 3: 
MARCY: "Ill murr vunn wee!"

Panel 4: 
WILBUR: "Hey mom!  Marcy just said Wilbur is funny!"
MARCY  (thought balloon): "It makes him happy"

B75

Panel 1:
Visual Description: Wilbur's living room. Marcy is nestled comfortably in a baby bouncer or blanket on the floor. Chuck the Rock is placed nearby, perhaps slightly closer than usual, as if observing her. Wilbur is in the background, out of focus, maybe reading a book or fiddling with the TV remote, completely oblivious.
Dialogue:
CHUCK (Speech Bubble, directly at Marcy): "Alright, kid. Welcome to the show. Hope you enjoy the scenery."

Panel 2:
Visual Description: Close-up on Marcy and Chuck. Marcy's head (huge, large nose, dot eyes) is tilted slightly towards Chuck. Her eyes are wide, showing a hint of surprise and dawning comprehension. Chuck remains a plain rock.
Dialogue:
MARCY (Thought Bubble, clear, direct, slightly surprised): "Wait... I understood that? You can talk!"
CHUCK (Speech Bubble, casual, slightly gruff): "Yeah, we talk. Seems you heard me, too. Smart kid."

Panel 3:
Visual Description: Marcy now has a frustrated expression (small furrowed brows, slightly narrowed dot eyes). Her gaze is directed off-panel, implying she's looking at other humans (like the oblivious Wilbur). Chuck is observing her reaction.
Dialogue:
MARCY (Thought Bubble, exasperated): "But... why can't I understand them? All the other noises they make! 'Goo goo gaa gaa'?! 'Where's the blanky'?! What's a blanky?!"
CHUCK (Speech Bubble, flat, matter-of-fact): "Ah, the humans. Yeah, they're mostly just noise."

Panel 4:
Visual Description: Marcy still looks a bit perplexed but also slightly thoughtful. Chuck is serene and calm, a wise, old rock.
Dialogue:
CHUCK (Speech Bubble, reassuringly, slightly cynical): "Don't worry, kid. You're not missing much. Trust me."
MARCY (Thought Bubble, slightly pacified, a hint of acceptance): "I guess not."



B76-73


Panel 1:
Visual Description: Junior is enthusiastically presenting something to Marcy, who is comfortably nestled in her baby bouncer on the floor. Junior is holding a complex textbook or a diagram with various lines and symbols, gesturing wildly with his free hand. Marcy is looking at him, a bit wide-eyed, taking it all in.
JUNIOR: "Alright, Marcy! For your first lesson, we'll delve into the foundational principles of quantum mechanics! Prepare to have your perception of reality utterly redefined!"

Panel 2:
Visual Description: Close-up on Marcy. Her huge head is tilted slightly. Her wide dot eyes convey concentration.
MARCY (Thought Bubble): "Wow, he's very excited about this. Such loud, happy noises. He must really like... whatever it is he's doing."

Panel 3:
Visual Description: Junior is leaning in, pointing intently at a specific part of the diagram or text in the book. His expression is serious and intense, deeply absorbed in the topic. Marcy is watching his hand movements and facial expressions.
JUNIOR: "Consider the dual nature of light – both particle and wave! A paradox that challenges classical physics and the very fabric of existence!"

Panel 4:
Visual Description: Junior is still animated, perhaps gesticulating with both hands now, caught up in the intellectual fervor. Marcy maintains her attentive, slightly tilted head.
MARCY (Thought Bubble): "Such passion! He's definitely enjoying himself. This must be a very fun sound to make, for him. I should remember that."


Panel 1:
Visual Description: Junior is on the floor in front of Marcy, attempting to assemble a small, intricate model (perhaps a miniature solar system or a complex molecular structure) made of various small, fiddly pieces. He looks a bit frustrated as a piece refuses to fit. Marcy is observing him calmly.
JUNIOR: "No, no, the orbital pathway must align! The gravitational pull... it's not maintaining! The adhesive properties... they're resisting!"

Panel 2:
Visual Description: Close-up on Marcy. Her eyes are narrowed slightly in a thoughtful way, interpreting his emotional state.
MARCY (Thought Bubble): "Oh dear. His noises are getting louder and a bit pointy. He's clearly agitated. I should probably do something to make him happy again."

Panel 3:
Visual Description: Junior lets out a frustrated sigh, slumping back. The small model pieces are scattered around him. He runs a hand through his hair.
JUNIOR: "It's conceptually sound, yet the variables conspire against me! How can I demonstrate the elegant symmetry of theory if the practical refuses to comply?!"

Panel 4:
Visual Description: Marcy reaches a tiny hand out from her bouncer and gently pats one of the loose model pieces. Junior looks down at her hand, a bit surprised, and then back at her face.
MARCY (Thought Bubble): "Maybe if I just... touch it. Sometimes that helps him relax his voice."


Panel 1:
Visual Description: Junior is now sitting slumped, head in hands, in front of Marcy. The scattered model pieces are still visible. He looks utterly defeated.
JUNIOR (Head in hands, muffled): "The complexities... the inherent resistance of the physical world to pure theoretical constructs... it's all so... frustrating! My brain aches!"

Panel 2:
Visual Description: Close-up on Marcy. Her expression is calm, almost pitying. Her thought bubble indicates her assessment of his state.
MARCY (Thought Bubble): "He's making very sad, low noises now. Like a broken toy. He needs a system reset."

Panel 3:
Visual Description: Junior looks up at Marcy, eyes wide with a mix of despair and a desperate plea for *some* sign of understanding, even if it's just a gurgle.
JUNIOR: "Marcy, do you understand any of this?! The fundamental forces! The grand design! The crushing weight of intellectual inadequacy?!"

Panel 4:
Visual Description: Marcy offers Junior a wide, sweet, and comforting smile. Junior looks at her, a bit stunned by her seemingly non-sequitur positive response.
MARCY (Thought Bubble): "He needs a nap. And probably some juice. Then he'll feel better and make happy noises again."
JUNIOR (Thought Bubble): "..."

WILBUR: "NO! Not 'shake a spear'! Shakespeare! It's his name! Put that down!"



Panel 1:
Visual: Wilbur is trying to explain the play to Alien 1 and Alien 2. He's gesturing towards the script.
WILBUR: "Okay, so it's a play. People pretend to be other people. Like a story, but live."

Panel 2:
Visual: Alien 1 and Alien 2 look at each other, confused.
ALIEN 1: "Pretend? Is this a form of advanced camouflage training, designed to infiltrate enemy social structures?"
Panel 3:
Visual: Wilbur sighs, rubbing his head.
WILBUR: "No, it's... for entertainment. It's not real. It's make-believe."

Panel 4:
Visual: Alien 1 and Alien 2 are now wearing crude, ill-fitting human masks (or perhaps just paper cutouts of human faces over their own drawn in wilbur art style). Wilbur looks horrified, taking a step back.
ALIEN 2: "Understood. We shall assume the designated 'human' forms for optimal immersion and dramatic fidelity."



Panel 1:
Visual: Wilbur is standing on a chair, striking a pose. Alien 1 and Alien 2 are observing intently.
WILBUR (Boasting): "Here comes Caesar! 'Beware the Ides of March!'"

Panel 2:
Visual: Alien 1 has activated a small, glowing force field around the chair. Alien 2 is attempting to place tiny, invisible traps on the floor around the chair.
ALIEN 1: "We shall ensure Caesar is adequately 'beware'd' of all surrounding threats to his personal integrity."

Panel 3:
Visual: Wilbur attempts to step off the chair and immediately trips over an invisible trap, falling awkwardly but safely into the force field.
SFX: "TRIP!" "OOF!"

Panel 4:
Visual: Wilbur is tangled in the force field, looking utterly exasperated. The aliens are looking at him with satisfaction.
ALIEN 2: "Mission accomplished, Zerk. Caesar has been successfully 'beware'd' of the floor surface."



Panel 1:
Visual: Wilbur is practicing lines, looking serious and conflicted. Alien 1 and Alien 2 are standing rigidly, as if listening to a formal presentation.
WILBUR: "'Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome more.'"

Panel 2:
Visual: Alien 1 is taking out a tiny, glowing lie detector device and aiming it at Wilbur. Alien 2 is meticulously taking notes on a small tablet.
ALIEN 1: "We must analyze the veracity of 'love for Rome' versus 'love for Caesar.' Human emotional constructs are complex."

Panel 3:
Visual: Wilbur looks at the device with confusion.
WILBUR: "It's acting, guys! It's not a real confession! I'm just saying lines!"

Panel 4:
Visual: The lie detector device flashes "INCONCLUSIVE." Alien 1 shrugs. Alien 2 crosses out notes with an irritated sigh. Wilbur looks frustrated.
ALIEN 2: "The data is... ambiguous. Human performance art appears to create significant truth-reading algorithm interference. Or the subject is a very skilled deceiver."

Panel 1:
Visual: Wilbur is passionately delivering lines from the play, gesturing dramatically. Alien 1 and Alien 2 are standing in front of him.
WILBUR: "'Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears!'"

Panel 2:
Visual: Alien 1 and Alien 2 have literally detached their antennae and are holding them out towards Wilbur. Wilbur looks completely aghast, eyes wide with the white circle of shock.
ALIEN 1: "As requested, Earthling. Superior auditory receptors for enhanced comprehension."


Panel 1:
Visual: Wilbur is reading a line from the script. Alien 1 and Alien 2 are listening.
WILBUR: "'For my part, I understood it not.'"

Panel 2:
Visual: Alien 2 taps Alien 1, pointing at the script.
ALIEN 2: "Ah, the phrase 'it was Greek to me,' Zerk. A common human idiom for incomprehension."

Panel 3:
Visual: Alien 1 looks smug, turning to Wilbur.
ALIEN 1: "We can assist with that, Earthling. We are fluent in ancient Terran dialects. Shall we elaborate on the nuances?"

Panel 4:
Visual: Wilbur looks bewildered. 
ALIEN 1: "Επίσης, η γλώσσα του Ομήρου είναι πολύ ενδιαφέρουσα!*" 
ALIEN 2: "Ναι, αν και οι μεταφράσεις συχνά αλλοιώνουν την αρχική έννοια.*" 
WILBUR (Thought Bubble): "...Now it really is Greek to me."
Boxed text below shows english translations:
* Also, the language of Homer is very interesting!
* Yes, although translations often distort the original meaning.

Panel 1:
Visual: Wilbur is explaining a stage combat scene, making some exaggerated lunging motions with his hands.
WILBUR: "So, the fight scene is supposed to look really dramatic, but no one actually gets hurt. It's all fake."

Panel 2:
Visual: Alien 1 and Alien 2 look at each other. Alien 1 pulls out a small, sleek alien stun device.
ALIEN 1: "Understood. Simulated incapacitation protocols initiated. Precision stunning for optimal visual effect."

Panel 3:
Visual: Wilbur is practicing a stage fall. Alien 2 suddenly blasts a nearby sofa cushion with the stun device, causing it to glow and smoke slightly.
SFX: "ZZZZZT! HISSS!"

Panel 4:
Visual: Wilbur is frozen mid-fall, looking terrified. The aliens are looking at him with satisfaction.
ALIEN 2: "Excellent impact simulation, Earthling. The cushion is sufficiently 'hurt' for dramatic realism. The audience will believe it."


Panel 1:
Visual: Wilbur is practicing lines, looking distressed and clutching his chest.
WILBUR (Dramatic): "'Is Brutus sick? And is it physical sickness we're talking about, or something else?'"

Panel 2:
Visual: Alien 1 has produced a large, glowing alien medical scanner and is aiming it at Wilbur. Alien 2 is looking at a small, flickering holographic display showing a strange, alien diagnosis.
ALIEN 1: "Emotional distress detected. Probability of internal thought loop at 87%. Elevated cortisol levels."

Panel 3:
Visual: Wilbur looks confused at the device.
WILBUR: "No, it's just a line about worry! He's not actually sick! It's metaphorical!"

Panel 4:
Visual: Alien 2 offers Wilbur a large, brightly colored, multi-tentacled alien "comfort snack" that looks like a miniature octopus. Wilbur looks horrified.
ALIEN 2: "Consume this nutrient paste. It is engineered to neutralize human emotional anomalies. And it's blueberry flavored, as per standard Terran preference!"



Panel 1:
Visual: Wilbur is dramatically delivering lines from the script he's holding, arms outstretched, looking intense.
WILBUR: "'Beware the Ides of March!'"

Panel 2:
Visual: Alien 1 is looking at a portable holographic projector, which is displaying complex charts and graphs of atmospheric data and gravitational fluctuations. Alien 2 is shaking his head.
ALIEN 1: "Our predictive algorithms do not concur. No planetary alignment anomaly detected, zero percent probability of micro-meteor showers."

Panel 3:
Visual: Wilbur looks puzzled, lowering his arms slightly.
WILBUR: "It's a prophecy! Like a warning about betrayal, not... meteors!"

Panel 4:
Visual: Alien 2 is pointing at a very small, harmless-looking dust bunny on the floor. Alien 1 is covering it with a tiny, transparent force field. Wilbur looks completely flummoxed, throwing his hands up.
ALIEN 2: "Indeed. We have mitigated the most significant observable threat for the upcoming 'Ides of March' period. Safety protocols adhered to."



Panel 1:
Visual: Wilbur is looking at a simple drawing of a Roman toga.
WILBUR: "Okay, for costumes, we'll need some simple togas. Nothing fancy."

Panel 2:
Visual: Alien 1 is using a device to "scan" Wilbur, a strange, shimmering light emanating from it. Alien 2 is taking notes on his tablet, looking at a diagram of human anatomy.
ALIEN 1: "Analyzing human epidermal characteristics for optimal material replication. Ensuring perfect epidermal integration."

Panel 3:
Visual: Wilbur looks confused and slightly nervous as the light surrounds him.
WILBUR: "No, just normal cloth! Like a bedsheet!"

Panel 4:
Visual: Wilbur is now wearing a toga that perfectly replicates his skin texture and tone, making him appear naked but in a toga shape. The aliens look proud.
ALIEN 2: "A perfect organic 'toga'! It integrates seamlessly with the subject's bio-signature and offers optimal thermal regulation!"
WILBUR (Blushing, hands covering himself): "This is... unsettling. And very breezy."


Panel 1:
Visual: Wilbur is looking at a drawing of a Roman dagger (a prop).
WILBUR: "And we'll need some prop daggers. Blunt, obviously. For safety."

Panel 2:
Visual: Alien 1 has produced a sleek, glowing energy blade. Alien 2 is handing it to Wilbur, holding it by the hilt.
ALIEN 1: "We have procured a 'dagger' with superior energy projection capabilities. It should be sufficiently 'blunt' for stage purposes, as it incinerates rather than cuts."
SFX: (from dagger) "WHOOSH! HUM!"

Panel 3:
Visual: Wilbur looks terrified, holding the glowing energy blade with extreme caution, his hands shaking.
WILBUR: "This is... a little too realistic for 'blunt'! It's glowing!"
SFX: (from dagger) "HUM!"

Panel 4:
Visual: Alien 2 demonstrates the blade by cutting a perfect, clean, smoking hole through a nearby wooden chair. Wilbur is aghast, eyes wide with the white circle.
SFX: (from dagger) "Kssssshh!"
ALIEN 2: "Indeed! It passes through solid matter with minimal resistance. Ideal for dramatic effect and authentic prop degradation!"
WILBUR (Sweat drops, screaming): "NO! MY MOM'S FAVORITE CHAIR!"



Panel 1:
Visual: Wilbur is explaining stage directions, pointing to a spot on the floor.
WILBUR: "Okay, so there's a line in another Shakespeare play that says 'Exit, pursued by a bear.' It's just a literary device, obviously."

Panel 2:
Visual: Alien 1 and Alien 2 look at each other, puzzled. Alien 1 taps a button on a small wrist device, scanning the room.
ALIEN 1: "Scanning for indigenous ursine lifeforms. Detecting proximity within current parameters."

Panel 3:
Visual: Wilbur looks increasingly exasperated, gesturing wildly.
WILBUR: "No, it's not a real bear! It's just written in the script to imply danger! It's not a physical creature!"

Panel 4:
Visual: A large, cartoony, grizzly bear suddenly appears mid-panel, looking confused and holding a tiny fish. Alien 1 is offering it a small, glowing fish. Wilbur is screaming and scrambling away.
ALIEN 2: "Our trans-dimensional summoning portal is highly efficient, Earthling. The requested 'bear' has arrived. Now, what's your 'exit' strategy, and is it optimal for ursine pursuit?"



Panel 1:
Visual: Wilbur is trying to practice speaking louder, perhaps shouting a line, looking frustrated.
WILBUR: "My voice needs to carry to the back of the auditorium! I'm not loud enough!"

Panel 2:
Visual: Alien 1 and Alien 2 are setting up a large, intricate alien sound amplification device next to Wilbur. It has many wires and glowing components, resembling a sci-fi megaphone.
ALIEN 1: "Optimal vocal projection requires a directed sonic emanation field. We shall ensure maximal auditory penetration."

Panel 3:
Visual: Wilbur looks nervous, stepping away from the device.
WILBUR: "It's just about speaking clearly and loudly, guys! Not... breaking the sound barrier!"

Panel 4:
Visual: Wilbur attempts to speak a line. A massive, distorted sound wave erupts from the device, shattering a nearby windowpane and knocking over a small table. Wilbur looks terrified, holding his ears, a look of pure shock on his face. The aliens look pleased.
SFX: "KRASSSHHH! BOOOOOM!"
ALIEN 2: "Indeed! We have achieved 120 decibel clarity! The audience will certainly hear you, and perhaps experience mild concussive effects!"



Panel 1:
Visual: Wilbur is talking to the aliens, looking a bit stressed, holding his script.
WILBUR: "The director says we need to 'connect with the audience.' Make them feel the emotions of the characters."

Panel 2:
Visual: Alien 1 holds up a small, shimmering, alien device with a happy face on one side and a sad face on the other. Alien 2 is looking at a console.
ALIEN 1: "We possess emotion-inducers calibrated for typical human neural pathways. Direct emotional transference is achievable."

Panel 3:
Visual: Wilbur looks aghast, recoiling from the device.
WILBUR: "No! We do it with acting! Through performance! Not... mind control! That's unethical!"

Panel 4:
Visual: Alien 2 is aiming the device at a cat sitting nearby. Wilbur is pulling at his hair in despair.
ALIEN 2: "Our preliminary tests on Feline Unit 7 indicate a highly responsive emotional spectrum! The data is promising for large-scale human application!"
WILBUR (Screaming): "STOP THAT! YOU'RE GIVING WHISKERS AN EXISTENTIAL CRISIS!"



Panel 1:
Visual: Wilbur is pacing nervously back and forth, clutching his script, sweat drops flying from his head.
WILBUR: "I'm so nervous! What if I mess up my lines? My heart is doing the bongo solo!"

Panel 2:
Visual: Alien 1 and Alien 2 are setting up a bizarre alien meditation device around Wilbur. It's emitting a soft, pulsating light and a low hum.
ALIEN 1: "Fear is an inefficient emotional state, Earthling. We shall induce alpha brainwaves for optimal performance and eliminate performance anxiety."

Panel 3:
Visual: Wilbur looks at the device, slightly confused but still nervous.
WILBUR: "I just need to breathe deeply or something. A simple relaxation technique."

Panel 4:
Visual: Wilbur is floating about a foot off the ground, perfectly still and serene, eyes vacant and expressionless. The aliens are looking at him with satisfaction.
ALIEN 2: "Our calming protocols are highly effective! The Earthling has achieved optimal pre-audition tranquility and achieved perfect levitation!"
WILBUR (Thought Bubble, slow, drawn-out): "Zzzzzzz... the void... is peaceful..."


Panel 1:
Visual: Wilbur (still slightly floating just inches above the ground now, as if held by an unseen force) is now on a small stage (or just in front of an unseen director's chair). He's trying to act a dramatic scene. Alien 1 and Alien 2 are positioned just off stage, holding various weird alien devices.
WILBUR (Attempting dramatic tone, slightly vacant): "'Et tu, Brute?'"

Panel 2:
Visual: As Wilbur delivers the line, Alien 1 shines a blinding spotlight-like beam directly onto his face. Alien 2 plays a tiny, dramatic sting on a small alien synthesizer that sounds like a cartoon villain's theme.
SFX (from synth): "DRAMATIC STING! (DUN-DUN-DUUUN!)"

Panel 3:
Visual: Wilbur blinks frantically into the blinding light, breaking character, he drops to the floor, still standing upright, but his eyes now wide with shock. The director (off-panel) clears their throat loudly, sounding annoyed.
DIRECTOR (OFF-PANEL, impatient tone): "Ahem. Let's try that again, Wilbur. Less 'deer in headlights,' more 'betrayed Roman.'"

Panel 4:
Visual: Wilbur is trying to recover, looking utterly flustered. Alien 1 looks at Alien 2, holding the spotlight device.
ALIEN 1: "Perhaps our 'dramatic enhancement' protocols were... too subtle? I detected insufficient emotional response from the judging entity."
ALIEN 2: "Unlikely. Human perception is notoriously obtuse. The director simply lacks an appreciation for true artistic intensity."


Panel 1:
Visual: Wilbur, Tom, and Julie are gathered around a bulletin board. Wilbur looks excited, pointing at it.
WILBUR: "The cast list is up! All those weeks of rehearsal! I hope I got a good part, maybe Caesar or Brutus!"

Panel 2:
Visual: Wilbur inspecting the cast list, profile view.
WILBUR: "Tom's Brutus! Cool! Wait... Crewcut as Caesar? How did that happen?"
DIRECTOR (OFF-PANEL): "Ah, Wilbur! Glad you're here. We found the perfect part for you. Unique talent required!  Your role is listed last!"

Panel 3:
Visual: Wilbur's face lights up with renewed hope, eyes wide with anticipation. Tom and Julie look curious, hopeful for him.
WILBUR (Thought Bubble): "Yes! All that rehearsal paid off! Maybe a new, pivotal character!"

Panel 4:
Visual: Bottom of cast list, with roles and names.  Final line: "Tree #3: Wilbur." 
DIRECTOR (OFF-PANEL, smiling broadly): "You're Tree #3! No lines, just stand perfectly still upstage left. You'll be rooted to the spot! You'll be great!"


Panel 1:
Visual: Wilbur (wearing a crudely drawn, very simplistic tree costume, looking utterly dejected, perhaps slumped) is standing next to Alien 1 and Alien 2. He's explaining his role while the aliens are looking at eachother, one os pulling out a watering can and a small leaf-shaped "seed".
WILBUR: "So, after all that, I'm a tree. I just stand there. No lines. At all."
ALIEN 1: "A 'tree' role? Is this a form of advanced botanical camouflage for infiltration purposes? A subtle observation post?"

Panel 2:
Visual: Alien 2 carefully places the seed directly onto Wilbur's shoe. Alien 1 points the watering can device at it, ready to activate.
ALIEN 2: "We can enhance the realism. This seed contains a rapid-growth accelerant. You will truly become the 'tree,' thereby embodying the role with unparalleled authenticity."

Panel 3:
Visual: The seed has immediately sprouted a vine that is rapidly growing up Wilbur's leg, starting from his shoe. Wilbur is screaming, already starting to pull off his shoe. The shoe is now partially covered in the growing vine. Alien 1 and Alien 2 look satisfied and proud, oblivious to Wilbur's distress.
WILBUR (Screaming, his voice cracking with panic, pulling off his shoe): "NO! I'M A TEENAGER!  I DON'T WANT TO PHOTOSYNTHESIZE! GET IT OFF! GET IT OFF!" 

Panel 4:
Visual: Wilbur successfully removes his shoe, which is left on the ground with the sprouting vine still attached to it, while his foot is now free and clear, panicked.
ALIEN 1: "He appears to be getting into character already! Such convincing botanical distress. Truly a dedicated method actor."
WIBUR: (slighly calmer, but frowning) "That was my good hiking boot..."




B128-129
Panel 1
Visual Description:
A familiar row of middle school lockers (125–129). Leaves are blowing down the hallway. One locker (127) has a single sad-looking sticker of a turkey on it. The lighting is cold and dim.

LOCKER 127: "Well, November’s here. Cold air. Wet backpacks. And the occasional mashed potato explosion."

Panel 2
Visual Description:
Slight zoom in. Lockers 126 and 128 now join the conversation. 126 has a slightly dented door; 128’s lock looks like it’s always slightly ajar.

LOCKER 126: "Someone shoved a parka into me yesterday. It was still wearing a sixth grader."
LOCKER 128: "I hosted a wet umbrella colony. I think they’ve unionized."

Panel 3
Visual Description:
Now focused mostly on Locker 127 again.

LOCKER 127: "Feels like the calm before the storm..."
LOCKER 128: "You mean midterms?"
LOCKER 127: "No. Pep Rally."

Panel 4
Visual Description:
Zoom out to include Locker 129 — the “forgotten” one from previous strips. Its door is slightly ajar. A tiny speech bubble pokes out.

LOCKER 129 (tiny, muffled): "Hey. Can I come out now? I’ve been in here since Spirit Week..."
LOCKER 126: "Was that… Greg again?"
LOCKER 128: "...we are so bad at this."


Panel 1:
Visual: School hallway, a row of lockers. Locker 204 looks dented and dusty.
LOCKER 204: “These kids bang us shut like we owe them lunch money.”

Panel 2:
Visual: Lockers 205 and 206 are now “talking” too.
LOCKER 205: “At least you don’t have ketchup fused to your back wall.”
LOCKER 206: “Pretty sure someone left a clarinet in me.”

Panel 3:
Visual: Close-up of Locker 205.
LOCKER 204: “One day they’ll understand—life is about knowing when to open... and when to stay closed.”

Panel 4:
Visual: Locker 206:
LOCKER 206 (quietly): “I contain six socks and a dead tamagotchi.”

JUNIOR: “New hierarchy: Level 1: Teeth.”


B131-139

Panel 1:
Visual: Wilbur walking outside on a breezy autumn day. A single, very crunchy-looking leaf swirls dramatically around his feet.
WILBUR (thought): “Don’t step on it. Be mature.”

Panel 2:
Visual: Wilbur keeps walking. The leaf rolls provocatively just ahead of his shoe.
WILBUR (thought): “Ignore it. You are above this.”

Panel 3:
Visual: Leaf lands perfectly in the center of the sidewalk like a red carpet.
WILBUR (frozen): “…”

Panel 4:
Visual: Wilbur leaps mid-air with cartoon intensity.
SFX: CRRRRUUUNCH!

Visual: Junior seated at a kindergarten table. A worksheet is in front of him with a big smiley face.
WORKSHEET: “What’s 2 + 2?”

Panel 2:
Visual: Junior writing intensely with diagrams and arrows.
JUNIOR (thinking): “Base ten mathematics... temporal context... possible decimal implications...”

Panel 3:
Visual: Worksheet now has 3 pages stapled to it.
Text: “Answer may be 4, but this might be too obvious.  Also possible the answer is 11 in base 3.”

Panel 4:
Visual: Teacher (offpanel) 
TEACHER: “...You know, a simple 4 would’ve worked.”
JUNIOR: “The question was ambiguous”



Panel 1:

Panel 3:
Visual: Wilbur walks past in the background, eating cereal loudly.
MARCY (thought): “Loud food man walks again.”

Panel 4:
Visual: Fan makes a small “ka-chunk” sound.
MARCY (thought): “Dangerous sky wheel may betray us all.”

Panel 2:
Visual: Wilbur struggles. The glove bends at a weird angle.
WILBUR: “Why are you fighting me?!”

Panel 3:
Visual: Close-up of glove, just lying there.
WILBUR (off-panel): “It’s literally your whole job!”

Panel 1:
Visual: Junior looks frustrated over a basic coloring sheet.
JUNIOR: “The trees are all the wrong shades. Chlorophyll doesn’t even LOOK like this.”

Panel 2:
Visual: Tom peeks over Junior’s shoulder.
TOM: “It’s okay. Just color it however you want.”

Panel 3:
Visual: Junior staring at Tom blankly.
JUNIOR: “Do you say that when NASA draws Mars with blue oceans?”

Panel 4:
Visual: Tom backing away slowly.
TOM: “Cool, cool, just... gonna let you win this one.”



Panel 1:
Visual: Julie in her room, holding a sweater.
JULIE (to herself): “This sweater feels like a hug.”

Panel 2:
Visual: Julie wraps it around herself, smiling.

Panel 3:
Visual: She sneezes violently.
SFX: “AAAH-CHOO!”

Panel 4:
Visual: Julie’s hair is now a frizz-ball of static.
JULIE: “Okay. 70% comfort, 30% betrayal.”



Panel 1:
Visual: Junior is standing over a puddle with a paper boat.
JUNIOR: “And thus, the S.S. Observation sets sail into the unknown.”

Panel 2:
Visual: Boat floats a few inches before getting stuck on a leaf.
JUNIOR: “Obstacle encountered. Deploying... stick.”

Panel 3:
Visual: Junior pokes at the boat with scientific intensity.
JUNIOR: “We will go around the leaf, or through it. History will remember this moment.”

Panel 4:
Visual: Boat tips, sinks instantly.
JUNIOR: “…History may forget this one.”



Panel 1:
Visual: Wilbur standing in front of a massive, overstuffed winter coat.
WILBUR: “Okay. This is just a coat. You’ve worn coats before.”

Panel 2:
Visual: Wilbur now tangled in sleeves. One arm is through the wrong hole.
WILBUR: “It’s winning. How is it winning?!”

Panel 3:
Visual: Marcy in the background watching, totally expressionless.
WILBUR (half-muffled): “No sudden movements... it senses fear.”

Panel 4:
Visual: Wilbur finally inside the coat, arms up in victory.
WILBUR: “Success!”
MARCY (thought): “Man vs fluff. Man barely won.”



Panel 1:
Visual: Julie holding a bright pink umbrella. It’s barely drizzling.
JULIE: “Some people prepare for storms. I prepare for aesthetics.”

Panel 2:
Visual: A gust of wind yanks the umbrella inside out.
SFX: FWUMP!

Panel 3:
Visual: Julie stares at the now-useless umbrella like it’s betrayed her.
JULIE: “Et tu, fashion?”

Panel 4:
Visual: She walks into the rain, hair slowly getting soaked.
JULIE: “Still prettier than a poncho.”






Panel 1:
Visual: Junior in the backyard with a clipboard and oversized magnifying glass, examining a pile of leaves.
JUNIOR: “Subject: Deciduous fallout. Category: highly crunchable.”

Panel 2:
Visual: He squats next to a leaf, poking it with his pencil.
JUNIOR: “Color variance suggests chemical withdrawal. Probably chlorophyll abandonment.”

Panel 3:
Visual: He steps on the leaf and listens.
SFX: CRUNCH!
JUNIOR (writing): “Auditory response: satisfactory.”

Panel 4:
Visual: Junior, satisfied, drops the clipboard like a mic.
JUNIOR: “Science is beautiful.”


Panel 1:
Visual: Marcy staring at a pile of socks in a laundry basket. Her expression is solemn.
MARCY (thought): “They go in pairs. And return... differently.”

Panel 2:
Visual: She touches a lone sock gently.
MARCY (thought): “This one looks lonely. It has no partner.”

Panel 3:
Visual: Chuck the Rock is in the corner. The matching sock has been placed over him like a hat.
CHUCK (thought): “It’s warm... and oddly floral.”

Panel 4:
Visual: Marcy smiles.
MARCY (thought): “Everyone gets to belong to something.”


Panel 1:
Visual: Wilbur staring at a blank worksheet.
WILBUR (thought): “Okay. If I stare at it long enough, maybe it’ll fill itself in.”

Panel 2:
Visual: Ten minutes later. Wilbur hasn’t moved. Eyes are wider now.
WILBUR (thought): “Still blank. It’s... resisting.”

Panel 3:
Visual: He puts a pencil next to it gently, like it’s bait.
WILBUR: “If you do the first answer, I’ll do the next three. Deal?”

Panel 4:
Visual: Paper remains blank. Wilbur slouches.
WILBUR: “You drive a hard bargain.”



Panel 1:
Visual: Julie is trying on hats in front of a mirror, looking increasingly skeptical.
JULIE: “Too floppy. Too round. Too… cereal-box mascot.”

Panel 2:
Visual: She puts on a stylish wide-brimmed hat. She strikes a pose.
JULIE: “Okay. This one says ‘mystery.’”

Panel 3:
Visual: Wind immediately takes the hat away.
SFX: WHOOSH!
JULIE: “This one also says ‘goodbye.’”

Panel 4:
Visual: Julie standing hatless, hair messed up, expression deadpan.
JULIE: “Fashion is a ruthless game.”



Panel 1:
Visual: Junior stands in the middle of the school hallway with a sign:
SIGN: “Do not say hi to me. It’s for science.”

Panel 2:
Visual: Wilbur walks by and waves.
WILBUR: “Hey, Junior!”

Panel 3:
Visual: Junior turns slowly.
JUNIOR: “You violated the control group.”

Panel 4:
Visual: Wilbur shrugs.
WILBUR: “Science will adapt.”
JUNIOR (writing): “Subject has no respect for boundaries. Or signage.”



Panel 1:
Visual: Marcy sneezes
SFX: KER-CHOO!

Panel 2:
Visual: Marcy freezes, looking mildly offended.
MARCY (thought): “...What was that?!   Did I pop”

Panel 3:

SFX: KER-CHOO!

Panel 4:
Visual: Marcie has a smile on her face.
MARCY (thought): “Okay. That’s fun.”



Panel 1:
Visual: Wilbur stands in front of his closed locker next to  Tom.
WILBUR: “Hey. Got any advice today?”

Panel 2:
TOM: “If you’re going to panic, do it early. That way, you’re ahead of schedule.”

Panel 3:
WILBUR: “That sounds unhelpful.”

Panel 4:
TOM: “You asked for advice. I didn’t say it was good advice.”


Panel 1:
Visual: Julie is at a table with Wilbur, Junior, and Tom. She looks exasperated.
JULIE: “Okay, we’re building a paper volcano. Let’s keep it simple.”

Panel 2:
Visual: Wilbur is trying to color it like Jupiter.
Tom is doing structural calculations.
Junior is trying to add “lava propulsion math.”

Panel 3:
Visual: Julie’s eye twitches.
JULIE: “This is supposed to erupt with vinegar. Not ambition.”

Panel 4:
Visual: Julie holding it together.
JULIE: “I’m going to paper-mâché my way through this.”



Panel 1:
Visual: Chuck on the porch as leaves fall around him.
CHUCK (thought): “Every year they drop. No warning. No parachutes.”

Panel 2:
Visual: A leaf lands directly on Chuck.
CHUCK (thought): “That one’s probably dramatic. I respect it.”

Panel 3:
Visual: Marcy in background, playing with another leaf.
CHUCK (thought): “The small one seems amused. She gets it.”

Panel 4:
Visual: Close-up of Chuck.
CHUCK (thought): “Decay’s just another way to land gracefully.”


Panel 1:
Visual: Wilbur opens the front door, sees a frosted-over yard.
WILBUR: “Oh. First frost.  finally happened.”

Panel 2:
Visual: Close-up of his breath in the cold air.
WILBUR: “I can see my regrets.”

Panel 3:
Visual: He steps outside, slips slightly.
SFX: Skid!

Panel 4:
Visual: Lying on the ground.   Another close up of his breath.
WILBUR: “Yep. There they go. All 9,337 of them.”






B150-154

One of my favorite arcs involved Wilbur and his brother centered around Christmas


Panel 1: Wilbur is remarking to Junior that christmas is just around the corner, and Junior asks what's so special about christmas
panel 2: wilbur decides to tell Junior about santa claus and how he goes around the entire world with flying reindeer and...
panel 3: Junior interrupts and says "Wait, flying reindeer?"  Wilbur says "yeah"
panel 4: Junior shouts "BULL!" so loudly and forcefly it shocks Wilbur off his feet

Panel 1: Wibur is still trying to bring some christmas magic to wilbur by going on about Santa and saying how he gives all the good children presents
Panel 2: Junior says "How much do we pay him?"  
Panel 3: Wilber replies "Nothing".  Junior says "Nothing?"
Panel 4: Again, Junior shouts "BULL!" so loudly and forcefly it shocks Wilbur off his feet

Panel 1: Wilbur is the only one in the frame, says "Stockings are ready, tree is all set up, tomorrow's Christmas!"
Panel 2: Still the only one in the frame, he says "But you still don't believe in Santa do you?"  Offpanel: "No" (presumably from Junior)
Panel 3: Wilbur is looking at Junior off panel and says "You're not nervous are you?"
Panel 4: Centered on Junior drawn in 4 different overlapping poses: "Nervous? Why do you think I'm nervous?"

Panel 1: Junior is at the foot of Wilbur's bed, saying "Wilbur, wake up!"
Panel 2: Wilbur groggily wipes his eyes and says "Junior, it's midnight!  What are you doing up?"   Junior says "You're not going to believe this but..."
Panel 3: "... I think I heard reindeer on the roof" (panel is completely centered on Junior at this point)
Panel 4: zoom out again, wilbur sitting up in bed, breaks fourth wall and says "I never thought he'd be the first in our group to crack up"

Panel 1: Wilbur: "You said you heard something from the roof?"  Junior  "Yeah, what if it's a burglar?"
Panel 2: Both standing and looking out the window 
Panel 3: Santa Claus (same art style): "On Dasher on Dancer, on Prancer, on Vixen, on Comet, on Cupid, on Donner and Blitzen"
Panel 4: Wilbur and Junior are both wordless, still standing at the window and staring at eachother in complete shock.



B155

Panel 1:
Visual Description: Wilbur is pushing a classic baby stroller on a quiet suburban sidewalk. Marcy sits in it, looking calm but her expression is neutral, bordering on disinterest. Wilbur looks relaxed, perhaps humming.
MARCY (Thought Bubble): "Another slow-paced perambulation. The visual stimuli are... predictably mundane."

Panel 2:
Visual Description: Same scene. Wilbur continues pushing, oblivious. Marcy has  the same pose.
MARCY (Thought Bubble): "Is this the extent of 'experiencing the world'? Where's the thrill? The unexpected sensory input?"

Panel 3:
Visual Description: CENTERED ON AN ANGRY BARKING DOG. The dog is a cartoonish breed (e.g., a bulldog or terrier mix) with raised hackles, bared teeth, and large, exaggerated bark lines emanating from its mouth. It could be straining against a leash or behind a fence, adding to the tension.
SFX: "GRRR! BARK BARK BARK! WOOF!" (Large, aggressive lettering)

Panel 4:
Visual Description: Wilbur is now practically sprinting, pushing the stroller at top speed. His feet are a blur, sweat beads flying from his head and a panicked expression. The stroller is bouncing wildly with motion lines. Marcy is perfectly secure, her large head is tilted back slightly, and she has a wide, joyous grin, thoroughly enjoying the rapid movement.
MARCY (Thought Bubble): "This is more like it! Finally, some action!"

B156

Panel 1:  Wilbur is standing mouth open and tongue out looking up as snow is gently falling down, wilbur's thought baloon reads "Catching snowflakes on your tongue is fun"
Panel 2: similar scene, but there is something falling straight for wilbur's face
Panel 3: Wilbur's eyes are closed and he looks like he is choking on something.  Sweat beads are flying from his head.  The sense of this panel should be purely viserial. All that surrounds him are a cacophony of sound effects: Ack!  Gasp!  Choke!  Koff Koff Koff! Spit! Gag!   PTUI!!!
Panel 4: resumes original pose, wilbur's thought baloon: "stupid bird"



B157-159

Panel 1:
Setting: Wilbur and Junior are huddled in a blanket fort made of bedsheets and couch cushions. A digital clock (showing 11:59 PM) glows beside them. Wilbur has snacks. Junior has a notebook and a flashlight.

WILBUR:
“Only one minute left in the whole year!”

JUNIOR:
“Does it vanish completely at midnight? Or is it... relocated?”

Panel 2:
Wilbur looks confused, holding a chip mid-bite. Junior is intensely writing a flowchart labeled “TIME: LINEAR??”

WILBUR:
“Relocated to where?”

JUNIOR:
“Unknown. Possibly to a temporal landfill. I call it ‘Chrono-dump 2025’”

Panel 3:
Clock hits 12:00 AM. Flash of light in the background. Wilbur’s eyes go wide with awe. Junior remains skeptical.

SFX: BEEP!

WILBUR:
“Whoa. It happened!”

JUNIOR:
“Time died. Long live time.”



Panel 1:
Wilbur and Tom are standing outside in jackets. Wilbur is staring into the sky with dramatic intensity. Tom is holding a juice box.

WILBUR:
“A new year means a new Wilbur. Bold. Brave. Responsible.”

TOM:
“You’re eating candy for breakfast.”

Panel 2:
Wilbur tosses the candy over his shoulder with flair.

WILBUR:
“Old Wilbur’s candy. New Wilbur starts... now!”

Panel 3:
Beat panel. Wilbur is staring into the distance, hands on hips. Tom looks at him sideways.

Panel 4:
Wilbur runs back to retrieve the candy, visibly panicked.

WILBUR:
“WAIT! That was the last red one!”



Panel 1:
Wilbur, Junior, Tom, and Julie are all sitting around on a blanket outside, each with a small slip of paper. Wilbur is leading the group like he’s running a workshop.

WILBUR:
“Okay, everyone! New Year’s resolutions! Let’s raise our self-expectations and then immediately forget them!”
Th
Panel 2:
Everyone reads theirs aloud. Tom is casual. Julie looks thoughtful. Junior stares at his with great intensity.

TOM:
“Mine says: ‘Be more patient to others.’”

JULIE:
“‘Be kinder to people, especially myself.’”

JUNIOR:
“‘Establish galactic supremacy by spring.’”

Panel 3:
Wilbur looks at Junior, visibly alarmed. Junior is already drawing a star map on the ground in chalk.

WILBUR:
“Uh... any chance you mean that metaphorically?”

Panel 4:
Junior is placing a juice box on the star map, labeling it “Earth.” He looks serious.

JUNIOR:
“I’ll let you know after Phase 3.”



B164

Panel 1:
Visual: Junior walks into the kindergarten classroom, carrying his backpack, surrounded by other kids sitting on the floor playing or drawing. Decorations from Christmas still hang on the walls, a little faded. Junior’s eyes are wide and serious.
Junior (Thought Bubble): "Okay... holiday's over.  Back to studying!"

Panel 2:
Visual: Junior sits at a tiny table with a blank piece of paper and a crayon. Other kids are scribbling wildly, some eating snacks, some playing with toys. Junior looks very focused, holding the crayon like a scientist with a pointer.
Junior (Thought Bubble): "Okay, social dynamics here deserve study.... I should take notes."

Panel 3:
Visual: Junior looks up at a group of kids who are gleefully throwing glitter everywhere and laughing loudly. His expression is a mix of disbelief and calculation.
Junior (Thought Bubble): "Hypothesis: Chaos equals fun. Must verify."

Panel 4:
Visual: Junior, now covered in glitter, holding the crayon awkwardly, one eyebrow raised. Nearby kids cheer and giggle. Junior is smiling broadly.
Junior (Thought Bubble): "Confirmed. Chaos is inevitable. Adaptation required."






Panel 1:
Setting: School hallway
JULIE: “Wilbur, want to see The Notebook tonight? They're replaying it at the theatre!”
WILBUR (excited): “Finally! A feature-length ode to office supplies!”

Panel 2:
JULIE (laughing): “Nooo, it’s a love story.”
WILBUR (already digging in bag): “Do they fall for each other in college-ruled or wide-ruled?”

Panel 3:
Julie stares at him, deadpan. Wilbur pulls out an unopened notebook with reverence.
WILBUR: “You think they’ll cover spiral envy? I’ve got theories.”

Panel 4:
Julie sighs. Wilbur salutes with a pencil.
WILBUR: “Let’s get emotionally perforated.”



Panel 1:
JULIE: “It’s not a real notebook. It’s a metaphor for their shared memories.”
WILBUR (writing furiously): “So a fake object holds emotional truths? Bold. Deceptive. Shakespearean.”

Panel 2:
JULIE (gently): “It’s a tear-jerking story about love and loss and finding each other again.”
WILBUR: “So it’s hide-and-seek but with tears. Got it.”

Panel 3:
Julie is almost impressed. Wilbur flips a page and continues writing
WILBUR (thinking out loud): “So if love = data, does heartbreak = corrupted file?”

Panel 4:
Julie buries her face in her hands.
WILBUR: “What’s the romantic recovery protocol? Ctrl-Z?”






Panel 1:
Setting: Dim theater. Romantic scene plays on screen.
JULIE (softly): “Wilbur… will you hold my hand?”
WILBUR (thought): “Hand request. Possible distress. Deploy protocol Alpha-2.”

Panel 2:
Wilbur rummages in panic. Julie watches, puzzled.
WILBUR (whispering): “Don’t worry. I’ve got supplies: flashlight, emergency juice box, Band-Aids...”

Panel 3:
He awkwardly presses the items into her hands like a survival kit.
WILBUR (whispering, serious): “Stay calm. If the situation escalates, we may need backup tissues.”

Panel 4:
Julie looks at him, deadpan. Wilbur grips his flashlight like a war hero.
JULIE (whispering): “Wilbur... it’s a kiss, not a category five storm.”
WILBUR (whispering): “Tell that to the music swell. That cello means business.”



Panel 1:
JULIE (dreamy): “He rebuilt her whole house just for her.”
WILBUR: “Without permits? In this economy? That’s not love, that’s zoning fraud.”

Panel 2:
JULIE: “But the kiss in the rain…”
WILBUR: “In soggy canvas shoes? Enjoy pneumonia and long-term regrets.”

Panel 3:
Julie looks deeply annoyed.
JULIE: “Did any of it touch your heart?”
WILBUR (thinking): “Technically, the dog was nice…”

Panel 4:
WILBUR (serious): “But rowing near swans? Irresponsible. You know they can kill a man?”
Julie facepalms.





Panel 1:
Setting: Tom and Julie's home. Tom is watching Julie come in.
TOM: “So… how was date night?”
JULIE: “He brought a notebook to The Notebook.”

Panel 2:
TOM: “Oof. Did he at least try to be romantic?”
JULIE: “He offered me a Band-Aid during the kiss scene. Said it was for ‘emotional abrasions.’”

Panel 3:
TOM: “...That’s either weirdly sweet or legally concerning.”
JULIE: “He also brought a flashlight, a juice box, and what I think was bear repellent.”

Panel 4:
Julie walks away, tossing jacket over her shoulder.
JULIE: “I’m dating a survivalist... for feelings.”
TOM (calling after): “Well hey, at least you’re emotionally waterproof!”




Panel 1
Visual: A quiet office desk. Papers are neatly stacked. A red stapler sits untouched. A coffee mug nearby.
STAPLER (thought):
"Another day. Another stack. I bind. I unify. I bring order to chaos."

Panel 2
Visual: A hand hovers above with a document. The stapler is about to be used.
STAPLER (thought):
"Yes. Feel the pressure. Let the metal teeth dance. Let me bite for purpose."

Panel 3
Visual: The hand sets the paper down... and reaches for a paperclip instead.
STAPLER (thought):
"...He chose the curvy one. A temporary fastener. A flirt."

Panel 4
Visual: Same scene, stapler still untouched. Nearby, the tape dispenser quietly hums.
STAPLER (thought):
"Fine. Go ahead. Let entropy win. See if she can hold your tax forms together when it all falls apart."
